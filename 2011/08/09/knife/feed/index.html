		<description><![CDATA[Delighted to hear that the mains deliver to such a high standard. I&#039;d visited before for a whisky tasting where they served a delicious variety of nibbles, presumably from their starter selection. I had all sorts of intentions of returning but never did; this salivacious review has renewed my interest.

At my previous visit I had a chat with one of the bar staff who explained the hotel hosted mostly business travellers, so they were busier during the week compared to the weekend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Word! Great review, Jess.

That rump steak was so, so, good. It was the most perfect Medium Rare I&#039;ve ever had, and the outside had that grilled ever-so-slight crunchy thing going on. Fab!

Upon bill-checking, I see that corkage was R30 a bottle. Pretty standard, I guess.]]></description>
