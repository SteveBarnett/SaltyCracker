		<description><![CDATA[Lovely review, Jess.

Going there has brought tapas to the front of my brain, and it seems to be sticking there. The four piece servings at Fork made it perfect for the Devouring Crackernauts.
I have a slight preference for communal eatings, buffet sort of thing, Thai sharing stylings (and Jo and I almost always do halfties). Tapas style eatings combines that with small portions, meaning lots and lots of tastes in one meal: how can that not be full of, as they say, WIN?

I may have to revise my cooking style a bit to small, many, courses kind of thing. :)]]></description>
