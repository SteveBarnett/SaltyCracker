		<description><![CDATA[The place gave me the weirdest sense of &lt;i&gt;surface&lt;/i&gt; - as though it was going through the motions of high-end nouvelle cuisine in its presentation and concept, but the food itself was a bit hollow. You can&#039;t say that squiggles of sauce make for fine dining if the sauce in question is indifferent mayonnaise, and it doesn&#039;t matter how fancy your menu is if every second dish is served with the same dollop of kimchi. The whole experience feels as though it&#039;s pretending to be something it isn&#039;t really. Which is a pity, because overall the food is actually quite good, and it was rather an enjoyable evening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the bit where we actually disagree - I loved the flavour complexities. Really interesting, layered, sophisticated. I do like to be silenced by the occasional mouthful while it demands my attention. However, I am absolutely in agreement on everything else. It&#039;s a bit of a soulless experience, and at that price I damned well demand soul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have been to Gypsy Cafe once and found it very nice. We went on a weeknight at 6, just as they opened, and about a month after they opened up shop. The food was very nice, if a little pricey for Obs. I did feel a bit odd when I asked if the chicken was free range and the dude was all &quot;blah blah cost, business decision&quot; etc. I wanted to say &quot;you&#039;re obviously going more upmarket than other Obs restaurants and price as such, surely you can afford FR chicken (which isn&#039;t actually that much more expensive)&quot;. Anyway, we&#039;d go back sometime if we remembered to. 

You guys should totally try Lion Corner, it&#039;s faaaaaaaaaabulous :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely review, Jess.

Going there has brought tapas to the front of my brain, and it seems to be sticking there. The four piece servings at Fork made it perfect for the Devouring Crackernauts.
I have a slight preference for communal eatings, buffet sort of thing, Thai sharing stylings (and Jo and I almost always do halfties). Tapas style eatings combines that with small portions, meaning lots and lots of tastes in one meal: how can that not be full of, as they say, WIN?

I may have to revise my cooking style a bit to small, many, courses kind of thing. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hah! I was afraid for a moment that you weren&#039;t going to mention the nanobots. It would have been a tragic and vital omission.

I have to put on record how amazingly cool and different a lunch-time meal slot is. It feels more relaxed, somehow, with less pressure to eat and be gone. We should do it more often. Salty Cracker brunchfests also have to be tried...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Delighted to hear that the mains deliver to such a high standard. I&#039;d visited before for a whisky tasting where they served a delicious variety of nibbles, presumably from their starter selection. I had all sorts of intentions of returning but never did; this salivacious review has renewed my interest.

At my previous visit I had a chat with one of the bar staff who explained the hotel hosted mostly business travellers, so they were busier during the week compared to the weekend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Word! Great review, Jess.

That rump steak was so, so, good. It was the most perfect Medium Rare I&#039;ve ever had, and the outside had that grilled ever-so-slight crunchy thing going on. Fab!

Upon bill-checking, I see that corkage was R30 a bottle. Pretty standard, I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We ate in Yindees a few months ago and to be honest it didnt really rock my world.  The food was okish, but no atmosphere, (we were there for Sunday lunch) and the room was very cold (it was winter, but...).  Since then I have eaten in Soho beside Jacks Pub, behind the new Cape Quarter - the first time it was excellent, the second time, not quite as good, but nonetheless i would recommend any Thai afficiandos to give it a try.  The nice thing there is that you can take the menu to the top outside deck and have your meal beside the lap pool with an uninterrupted view of the mountain, pretty amazing.]]></description>
