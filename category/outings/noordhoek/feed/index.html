				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayiee, it has been way too long, and my knuckles need rapping.</p>
<p>I took the crew to Noordhoek, to finally try the Foodbarn, which is done by that guy who did that thing (guy &#8211; Franck Dangereux*, thing = La Colombe). The idea is that it&#8217;s wonderful food in a comfortable environment, a little less pretentious than the high-food places but not compromising on quality. On the whole, they succeed beautifully and it was a lovely outing.</p>
<p>The setting is brilliant &#8211; I&#8217;d like to go back for lunch to have a better feel. The little farm village is quaint, there are few streetlights on the way there (almost missed that turn), and the barn itself (and it is a barn, very nicely converted) is beautifully decorated (I liked the fake-window mirrors, and spoons in windows. I think.). There is an upstairs area, where we were seated, up a very narrow staircase that gives credit to the waiters.</p>
<p>The service was great &#8211; chatty, informal, helpful and interesting. If a little too busy &#8211; the restaurant was full and sometimes it was difficult to find our waitress who did the whole upstairs area by herself. But she was very nice when found, and overall a good experience on the service.</p>
<p>The food is interesting. They have at least 2 menus &#8211; the a la carte and the Bistro (there is also a Degustation menu none of tried) . The Bistro is a set price menu with a number of courses for a fixed price (R185 for 3 courses if memory serves) which is a fantastic price. I had that, while everyone else had the a la carte. This created a strange discrepancy on the table &#8211; a lot of the Bistro dishes were almost exactly the same as the a la carte ones, but slightly smaller and lacking one or two ingredients (prawns, or truffles). They both worked, and I see the point of the smaller courses (I had room for desert), but I did feel like a poor cousin a little and would recommend everyone does one menu or the other together to avoid this subtle feeling of discrimination.</p>
<p>The food was excellent &#8211; I had:</p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Fresh fish tartare with lemon and chives, served on avo pulp with aioli, finished with minute fried curried calamari</div>
<div>
<div>Rack of  lamb roasted in a mustard and bread crust, served with a tomato and olive tart “Tatin” , finished with a rich garlic jus</div>
<div>and something for desert that I have unfortunately forgotten (or they&#8217;ve changed the menu since none of the options on the website look familiar).</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>The fish was wonderful, very fresh and interesting flavours. The &#8220;grown up&#8221; a la carte version had extra prawns, which weren&#8217;t necessary in my view, but I didn&#8217;t get to taste Eckie&#8217;s so may be wrong! The lamb was nice &#8211; the truffle version on the other menu was much better (Jess had that) and Steve&#8217;s steak was also nice, but in the end I felt there was too much &#8220;brown gravy&#8221; type of tastes in the mains and not enough distinctive flavours.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>On the whole, I really like the place. Will definitely go back. Worth exploring the Bistro menu but don&#8217;t let others show you up with the a la carte. Lunch needs to be tried. On the negative side, a little too busy and while the flavours are lovely, I was missing that spark of genius that combines unexpected flavours into taste explosions (TM) &#8211; but that is setting the bar very high.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8/10 (would be 9/10 if it were slightly less busy/crowded)</div>
<div><strong>Staff</strong>: 9/10 (intelligent, informed, friendly)</div>
<div><strong>Service</strong>: 6/10 (lovely and friendly but need one or two more!)</div>
<div><strong>Food</strong>: 8/10 (excellent)</div>
<div><strong>Value for money</strong>: 9/10 for the bistro, 7/10 for the a la carte.</div>
<p>*Dangereux? really? Life&#8217;s not fair when other people have such awesome names.</p>
