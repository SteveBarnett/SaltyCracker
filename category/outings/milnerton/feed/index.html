				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eckie&#8217;s choice very often inclines towards steakhouses, which is always interesting. Steakhouses seem to exist on a different planet to other kinds of restaurant &#8211; other scales of value, other avenues towards spectacular success or horrendous fail. Where an upmarket nouvelle joint can be dire in the area of pretentious, unexciting or downright annoying, a poor steakhouse can be basic, rote or plain bad. On the other hand, a really good steakhouse has a particularly happy confluence of generous portions of excellent food, an inspired focus on steak, and the sort of warm, relaxed atmosphere which gives a meal a particular glow. Dale&#8217;s is in this category. We had a fabulous evening.</p>
<p><a>Dale&#8217;s Black Angus</a> is in Milnerton, in The Paddocks, which is one of those glitzy shopping malls. This is usually not a recommendation in terms of atmosphere, but one is immediately reassured on walking up to the restaurant, which is an open double-storey with white-linened tables spilling out in a slightly café style from its open front wall. There&#8217;s a lot of wood panelling and wooden furniture; the slightly over-shiny cocktail bar is sealed off from the main room, and there are booths along two walls. A booth is the best possible restaurant dining configuration, as far as I&#8217;m concerned. You are insulated from other people&#8217;s noise and free to be less concerned about your own. (Ours can rise sharply about a third of the way through the second bottle of wine).</p>
<p>The place is large, with an upper level, and with a fairly high number of excellently-trained waitstaff scurrying about. This is fast becoming a notable index of restaurant quality &#8211; professional trained staff versus part-time student types. Worlds of difference. It&#8217;s essentially a warm and welcoming space, with a sort of family feel which is initially suggested by the name, and reinforced by the discovery, from our waiter, that the bar is named after the owner&#8217;s son, with whom the waiter went to school. (He was a good waiter. It took him about ten minutes to twig to the usual level of Salty Cracker nonsense, after which his responses were pitch-perfect). The service is quick, and even if it wasn&#8217;t, the walls are covered with wooden plaques containing interesting and possibly apocryphal quotes from a variety of Famous People, which you can read while you&#8217;re waiting. You can also amuse yourself with the menu, which, apart from the entertaining warning on the front page (&#8220;Unattended children will be given a double expresso and a free puppy&#8221;), is huge and full of delectable stuff.</p>
<p>The starter course is often the Achilles Heel of a steakhouse, in that you can frequently feel the perfunctory attention given to it while the chefs concentrate on the steak. This, however, wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not a huge selection of starters and it hits all the usual buttons for steakhouse opening gambits (calamari/crumbed mushrooms/prawn something/deep-fried camembert), the huge and blinding difference being how bloody good they all are. Honestly, the feel is far more fine-dining than perfunctory-steakhouse; interesting ingredients, fascinating flavour combinations, beautifully prepared and served. My crumbed mushrooms were stuffed with bacon and cream cheese; Steve&#8217;s deep-fried camembert came with fig preserve and toasted nuts. My memory is going a bit, but I think Jo had some sort of carpaccio thingy which was also excellent.</p>
<p>I was very tired that evening, and didn&#8217;t feel up to steak. (I don&#8217;t eat a lot of red meat in the large-chunks sense, and need to get a bit of a run-up on steak). I had the duck à l&#8217;orange, flambéed with Van Der Hum and served with a marvellous jug full of excellent orange sauce, and it was very good, but not as good as the steak. I should have manned up and had the steak. Dale&#8217;s chateaubriand is quite possibly the best steak we&#8217;ve had in Cape Town (there was extended debate on this topic), and the Special Reserve is almost as good. Beautifully tender, cooked perfectly, excellent sauce béarnaise on the side &#8211; I do approve of the Giant Jugs o&#8217;Sauce approach. The nice waiter tried to take ours away before we&#8217;d finished, and was properly apologetic once he&#8217;d recovered from the yells of outrage.</p>
<p>We were enough in the swing of things that we even had dessert; Jo and I shared an excellent baked cheesecake, Steve had the citrus-infused crême brûlée, which I know I tasted, but which I absolutely could not remember tasting two minutes after the fact. (No blame to the brûlée, but I was tired enough at that stage to be hallucinating slightly). And the three courses, with two bottles of rather good wine (their winelist is rather more than adequate), didn&#8217;t actually come to hideously huge amounts (R300 or so per person?); this is very much fine dining at upper-level steakhouse prices.</p>
<p>So, on the Patented Jo Scale, scoring rather high all round:<br />
<strong>Overall:</strong> 8.5 / 10<br />
<strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8.5 / 10 (Warm, comfortable, family vibe)<br />
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8.5 / 10 (Great! well trained, friendly, both amusing and amused.)<br />
<strong>Service</strong>: 8 / 10 (Good, only a couple of minor delays in things like water refills)<br />
<strong>Food</strong>: 8 / 10 (Steakhouse +++, straightforward dishes elevated by flavours and preparation)<br />
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 8.5 / 10</p>
