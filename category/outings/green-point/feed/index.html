				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Review in brief:</strong><br />
food generally good, generous portions, reasonable prices, service a bit lacking.</p>
<p>So, after dipping out off a wine farm lunch on Friday due to time and heat constraints, we decided to Crack our Salty selves on Saturday instead.</p>
<p>I was in the mood for some Japanese food, but specifically not sushi. So, after hitting the <a href="http://eatout.co.za/">Eat Out</a> and <a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/">Dining Out</a> sites and the EO book, I chose Benkei (<a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_menu.asp?MemberID=2834">menu at DO</a>).</p>
<p>We did our usual frisky food swapping.<br />
Our starters were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuna, Ginger and Wasabi Spring rolls with Sweet Chilli sauce,</li>
<li>Chicken Yakitori, kebab-style</li>
<li>Seafood Yakitori,</li>
<li>Tempura prawns, fish, calamari and veggies</li>
<li>Sashimi salad.</li>
</ul>
<p>All were pretty nummy, but special mention goes to the Spring Rolls (crunchy and good tuna) and the tempura (nice and crispy, good side sauce).<br />
You may notice that there were five starters for four people.<br />
We were hungry :).</p>
<p>Our mains were Teppanyaki stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beef Fillet</li>
<li>Seared Tuna Steak x 2</li>
<li>Seafood Platter (fish, prawns, calamari steak)</li>
</ul>
<p>They took quite a while bringing out the starters, and the mains arrived almost the instant they took the starters away, which was not great.<br />
The tunii arrived seared to perfection, but unfortunately a bit cold. So, we sent them both back to be warmed up and they returned pretty much cooked. I was a bit miffed, but the fishies were still very tasty.<br />
The Beefy was done just right (nice and pink and soft and good), and Eck&#8217;s seafood-for-two was a decent mix of denizens of the deep. I admit to being surprised that he managed to get the whole lot down &#8211; it was a whole lotta fish!</p>
<p>Overall quality of the service could be improved.<br />
The waiters were friendly, but not quite attentive enough &#8211; we had to call our guy back to open our first bottle of wine for us (and I get <em>very</em> tetchy when I don&#8217;t have a drink in my hand soon after sitting down ;-] ).<br />
And I was a bit annoyed by the fact that they started closing up the place while were still sitting there eating. This was before 10pm on a Saturday evening. Admittedly, we were the last ones there, but still.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m glad that I chose there, and I had a pleasant evening, but I won&#8217;t hurrying back there.<br />
Plenty more Japanese joints to try!</p>
<p><strong>Non-food information confirmed during the meal:</strong><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimshot">rimshot</a> is the technical term for the bdum-tss at a punchline. Not to be confused with (NSFW) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimjob">rimjob</a>, (Arnold Judas) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rimmer">Rimmer</a>, or just plain old (bling, mofo!) <a href="http://images.google.com/images?rlz=1C1GGLS_enZA291ZA307&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;q=rims&#038;um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;sa=N&#038;hl=en&#038;tab=wi">rims</a>.</p>
