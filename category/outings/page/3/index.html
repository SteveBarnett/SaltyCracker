<p>Most of my ongoing missions in life involve food. This pleases me.<br/>
One of them is to find good Dim Sum places in Cape Town.<br/>
My current winner is U-Seng in Table View (which is another story in itself), but Xiang Yuan provides a good local alternative.</p>
<p>The decor inside is that classic &#8220;basic but clean&#8221; look. Slightly skanky lookin&#8217;, to be honest. I have a particular penchant for places that have good food but very simple decor (such as Jewel Tavern when it was in the docks). The other Crackernauts tend to err more of the side of posh, which only encourages me to bring the skank back in. It enhances that &#8220;hidden gem&#8221; feeling for me.</p>
<p>We often like to get recommendations, and the staff at Xiang Yuan were friendly, helpful, and made excellent suggestions. Alas, it has been a few weeks since we were there, and my memory of individual dishes has faded. We had a mix of Dim Sum from their big and varied menu, and added the much-loved duck and pancakes combo to the table. Everything was excellent, and the prices were good (and <em>very</em> reasonable compared to big names like Simply Asia or Tong Lok).</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 4 / 10 (Not great. TV on in an unavoidable place. Lights kinda bright.)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 7 / 10 (Friendly, slightly surprised, very helpful with the recommendations.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 6 / 10 (Good, but not great. Solid, but not shining.)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (Good Dim Sum (wide selection, all tasty), excellent duck.)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 8 / 10 (Competitively priced)</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>This month&#8217;s Cracker has been rather delayed, owing to both disorganisation and illness on my part; this may or may not have contributed to the fact that I really felt like something relaxed, low-key and &#8220;ethnic&#8221; for this month. We ended up trying <a href=http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_menu.asp?MemberID=4611">Park&#8217;s Menu</a>, in Durban Rd, Mowbray, at the recommendation of Jo &amp; Stv, who have eaten there a couple of times. This was, it transpires, a genius suggestion that seriously hit the spot, even before the bit with the evening&#8217;s special which entailed the cute pirate-chest dicebox and the free bottle of wine. (Snake eyes! our third bottle of wine for the evening, and it&#8217;s probably lucky I didn&#8217;t roll the free dessert, we&#8217;d never have fitted it in).</p>
<p>Although this is a Korean restaurant, the décor is really more English cottage chintzy than anything else &#8211; painted wooden furniture, cottagey still lives on the walls, odd bits of Victorian bric-a-brac, floral cushions on the chairs. It has a lovely, relaxed vibe, and the stainless steel stove tables for the hotpot really don&#8217;t feel as incongruous as you&#8217;d think. The staff are Korean and absolutely lovely &#8211; attentive, warm, relaxed. I had the impression that our table guy was (a) probably the owner, (b) probably the chef, and (c) really loved what he was doing. He apparently exports wine as another venture, and it&#8217;s entirely possible that Park&#8217;s is a sideline he does purely for his own enjoyment. If so, it shows.</p>
<p>I have to digress a moment. They brought us kimchi and bean sprouts as nibbles while we swigged rosé, and I have to say: kimchi? why has no-one ever <em>told</em> me? It&#8217;s marvellous stuff. This was quite bitey, but in a really good way, and the bean sprouts had a subtle spice thing going on that was also excellent. I am a new convert to Korean food. Bring it on, preferably instantly.</p>
<p>We stretched this out into three mediumish courses rather than the traditional starter/main, and had dumplings to start with. I adore dumplings, and these were particularly good &#8211; we had the steamed chicken and the fried pork ones. The fillings were distinctively spiced, and the fried pork dumplings were excellently crispy. Probably the best dumpling experience I&#8217;ve had in Cape Town, actually. I&#8217;m wishing I still worked at home, so I could head down the road and have lunch there. Often. I am fast developing a love affair with the Korean spicing.</p>
<p>Phase one of the mains comprised two of their dishes, Galbi and Ssambap, and I have to add in parenthesis that I&#8217;d be madly inclined to eat a lot more Korean food not just because the flavours and textures are lovely, but because the names are too. Galbi is an odd concept, beef rib that&#8217;s basically been long-stewed so it&#8217;s soft and tasty, but served in a broth with a lot of vegetables that have clearly been added at the last minute. You get the best of both worlds &#8211; tender, falling-off-the-bone stewed beef with crispy vegetables. Really excellent. The ssambap was probably my favourite, though &#8211; a spicy pork/rice thing which you ladle onto lettuce leaves and eat like a wrap, with various spicy sauces. I love self-constructed finger food, and this was a particularly good one, with very much what seems to be the signature Korean thing of lightly-cooked, low fat dishes with interesting spices. The portions are generous, we were starting to be full after two starters and two main courses between the four of us.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the main course entailed a move to one of the fancy hot-plate tables, for hot-pot. They bring out a stainless steel dish with a sort of off-centre yin-yang curvy partition in it; sweet broth in one side, spicy in the other. Then the nice waiter main struggles out from the back with a giant trolley laden with raw food &#8211; mussels, prawns, crab sticks, bok choy, mushrooms, tofu, and a huge plate with carefully-rolled strips of thinly cut pork. The broth simmers on the hotplate; you have chopsticks and a couple of ladles, and you fling the food into the broth and cook it lightly before dipping it in peanut and/or chilli sauce, and noshing like mad. When you have, in defiance of the enormous meal you already ate, polished off the entire contents of the platters, you tip the last of the peanut sauce into your bowl with scoops of broth, and drink it like soup. This was enormously good fun, and I rather fell for both bok choy and tofu prepared thusly (the tofu explodes in a shower of broth when you bite into it), but in comparison to the flavours in the more conventional main courses, I found it a bit bland. (I may also be biased in that I&#8217;m not a huge fan of seafood). This will not, however, prevent me from instantly trying to emulate it at home with a fondue pot. Oh, no, indeedy.</p>
<p>It was a lovely evening. I really like this place, and propose to upgrade it instantly to the status of &#8220;neighbourhood hang-out&#8221;. I also note, with sadness and disapproval, that it was almost empty; it deserves to be popular and bustling and disseminating its culinary happiness to a much wider clientele. I therefore exhort anyone reading this to rush off immediately and eat there. If you don&#8217;t it may go under, and I&#8217;ll be devastated.</p>
<p>Assessment on the Patent Jo Scale, with a terribly uniformity because I really had a great time:<br />
Atmosphere: 8/ 10 (a warm and distinctly original vibe)<br />
Staff: 8/ 10 (lovely people, attentive and engaged)<br />
Service: 8 / 10 (quick, attentive)<br />
Food: 8 / 10 (large menu, lovely cuisine, nicely prepared)<br />
Value for money: 9 / 10 (good lord, it&#8217;s absurdly cheap)</p>

		<p>This was not our first time at La Mouette (well, not for all of us), but it was first time with Salty Cracker. We had discovered it last year just after they opened, and have been there before. Basically, extremely highly recommended place: excellent food, excellent value for money. Double excellent in May: they are running a two for one special that gives you 6 courses, normally a very reasonable R240 per person, at R240 for two people. You can’t get better than that, and the portions are very generous to boot.</p>
<p>I will digress briefly and slightly contradict myself. Latest discovery about self: despite years of training and hard work, a tasting menu is too much for me. I must face facts. We have had a number of opportunities to test this recently and it’s all coming together. Last month at Overture, we tried the tasting menu (8 courses, tiny). Then, for a hen party, the 6 course menu at Myoga (excellent range of options, really good value). And now 6 courses at La Mouette. In all cases, I am experiencing two problems:</p>
<p>1.	It’s too much food to be able to enjoy all the flavours. Towards the end, I’m saturated.</p>
<p>2.	I miss out on reading the menu properly and thinking about the flavours and combinations. In two of the above (La Mouette and Overture), the tasting menu is fixed – no choices. That’s not a problem in terms of variety or getting something you don’t like – it’s all good – but it does mean I don’t look at the menu with a serious and discerning eye. I think that removes some of the fun of anticipation and appreciation of the more trace ingredients.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think I’ll be sticking to a la carte for the foreseeable future. But back to La Mouette, because despite the rant above, that was a fine dining experience.  The restaurant is set in a wonderful old house in Sea Point (right at the end of Main Road, near Shoprite). The decor is rich and baroque, and there was a roaring log fire that meant I went from toasty to I-need-to-go-outside-to-get-some-air (I was really close to the fire).</p>
<p>The staff is friendly, they bring tap water without any hassle (this seems to be the norm now, bottled water be damned), and generally looked after us very well. I had a half a victory: the set desert was the warm chocolate profiterole, but I hinted that I would have liked to try their gin-and-tonic desert, and they said no problem! When it came to desert, they brought me the profiterole though, and I was too full and tired to object. It was, in any case, magnificent (the almond icecream was nougaty and devine), so I squeezed it in, at which point the waiter apologised and wanted to bring me the ginantonic, and I had to say no. Self preservation. Anyway, mistake gracefully handled.</p>
<p>Ok, the set menu is <a href="http://lamouette-restaurant.co.za/menu/tasting-menu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article-int', 'http://lamouette-restaurant.co.za/menu/tasting-menu/', 'here']);" >here</a>. Particular stand outs are their croquettes (they are famous for these things, wonderful cheesy little lovebites);  the roast fish and risotto – brilliant, warm flavours, well combined;  and the desert was just heavenly. The warm pimms-themed first course is more like a tiny palate cleanser, but all other five courses are full sized, armed and dangerous. The pork belly is perfectly done and rich, and the onion soup is creamy and cheesy. There is no getting off easy.</p>
<p>Oh, one final word of warning – skip the wine pairing. It’s relatively pricey (R180), the wines are nice but not brilliant, the portions are sufficient but not large. All of the pairings are white except for the pork belly’s match. I’d recommend a nice bottle of chardonnay for the meal and perhaps a glass of Merlot for the pork, it will be fine.</p>
<p>Scores:</p>
<p>Atmosphere: 8/10 (did I mention the table of blondes? It’s probably not a permanent feature, but the big function room table just in front of us was taken up by impossible number of impossible leggy blondes. Very distracting. Very mysterious. This does not affect the rating though. )</p>
<p>Staff: 8/10 (helpful, friendly, mistake made but fixed)</p>
<p>Service: 8/10</p>
<p>Food: 8/10 (brilliant but heavy going – proper winter food)</p>
<p>Value for money: 11/10. I’m not kidding.</p>

		<p>I was, of course, tempted to write this review in Haiku format.<br />
But I did not.<br />
Be thankful.</p>
<p><a href="http://bukhara.com/haiku/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bukhara.com/haiku/', 'Haiku']);" >Haiku</a> was great. I&#8217;ve had my Japanese-Cracker hand forced slightly due to lack of availability (if you know a good Japanese restaurant in Cape Town, please drop it in the comments!), so I&#8217;ve expanded my general theme to <em>Asian, preferably Japanese (because i like it), preferably not Thai (because we eat it at home a lot).</em></p>
<p>The place itself is tres chic. The bar at the front is particularly swish. We&#8217;re talking dark furnishings, a few shiny bits, and lots of spotlights (hung from the tall, tall, ceiling to head high (ish)). It felt a little too trendy for me, to be honest, but the staff were welcoming and friendly (and I&#8217;m not exactly Mr TrendyPants (as evidenced by me saying Mr TrendyPants)). The back 4/5 of the place is the restaurant, with a strip all the way down one side being the kitchen and the gaggle (pot? susan? broth?) of chefs, all specialists in their various bits.</p>
<p>The menu is <strong>big</strong> (and missing from their web site &#8211; boo). Three pages big, packed with tasty-sounding treats. It&#8217;s divided into sections by style more than by country, so you have stir-fried dishes together, tempura stuff together, and so on.<br />
Roughly speaking, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li>veggie tempura (solid, but not amazing. Great sauce, though);</li>
<li>soft shell crab tempura (very good. Crunchy!);</li>
<li>Chicken and mushroom hotpot (a surprise star. Recommended by the waiter on the grounds of being a lot more interesting than it sounds. He was right!);</li>
<li>Dim Sum (<strong>lots</strong> of dim sum. I think I may have found a place to return to regularly for Dim Sum &#8211; is good, me like.);</li>
<li>Cheung Fun (chinese canneloni, which I remember first having as chopstick-test by Chinese friends in London.);</li>
<li>duck pancakes (of course. Hat tip JT. Good, but not amazing);</li>
<li>Beef katsu (breadcrumbed, seared, cow.);</li>
<li>Thai salad (the weakest dish of the lot. A bit too fusion, so it lost it Thai character);</li>
<li>Sizzling ostrich (juicy and tasty, but not mind-blowing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! And I&#8217;m sure I missed some. We definitely over-ordered. But then, it was Salty Cracker. :)</p>
<p>Service was good, but very slightly patchy. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, except for a short period near the end-game when I was wanting water and to ask for the bill.</p>
<p>Ratings? Ratings.</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 7 / 10 (Very trendy, but still nice for &#8220;normal&#8221; folk. Ahem.)<br />
<strong>Staff</strong>: 9 / 10 (Friendly, chatty, excellent knowledge of the menu, very good with recommendations.)<br />
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (No real complaints, but wouldn&#8217;t mention it as special.)<br />
<strong>Food</strong>: 8 / 10 (A wide spread of countries and styles without feeling stretched or that there are any &#8220;filler&#8221; items (iyswim), and very, very, tasty.)<br />
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 6 / 10 (Pricey for what is, especially the Dim Sum.)</p>
<hr /><strong>Addendum:</strong> We jetted off to <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/02/29/jewel-tavern/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/02/29/jewel-tavern/', 'the Jewel Tavern']);" >the Jewel Tavern</a> last night for a quick Chinese comparison. It&#8217;s a tough call, to be honest. Jewel has a lot more of the classics, and it does them very well, at a good price. Haiku&#8217;s Chinese section contains more unusual stuff, but at a higher price point.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We&#8217;ve had a fairly high proportion of upmarket choices for Salty Cracker lately &#8211; culminating, in fact, in the expensive delights of <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2010/11/02/the-roundhouse-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2010/11/02/the-roundhouse-2/', 'the Roundhouse']);" >the Roundhouse</a>, plus a recent Overture visit &#8211; and I was very much in the mood for something rather more cosy and informal. We also had a sampling of Addis in Cape&#8217;s food as takeout at a friend&#8217;s birthday party a month or so ago, and I was still queasy after gastric &#8216;flu at the time and definitely wanted to revisit the cuisine <i>properly</i>, so <a href="http://www.addisincape.co.za" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.addisincape.co.za', 'Addis in Cape']);" >Addis in Cape</a> it was. This is Ethiopian food, and it completely hit the spot in terms of the vibe I wanted.</p>
<p>Addis is in Long Street, on the corner of Church, and is a cheery red-painted building on three floors, with a very lovely feel in terms of d&eacute;cor. Sod&#8217;s Law, however, naturally dictated that the one time we have to climb two flights of stairs to eat, has to be the month in which Jo has put her knee out and is hobbling around with a crutch. There is, alas, no lift, and I have to say it would probably wreck the vibe if there were. The staff were very concerned and sweet about her slow and epic ascent. It&#8217;s a typical old Long Street building, wooden floors and old plaster, and they&#8217;ve incorporated the feel into the decoration &#8211; bits of the walls have artfully-left patches of bare brick, which goes very nicely with the wooden chairs and basketwork, and the slightly run-down feel gives a very strong sense of African street-market. The colours are all orange and red, warm and slightly smoky with candles, and the restaurant&#8217;s habit of burning incense as part of the coffee ceremony means that the whole thing smells slightly exotic, a sensual vibe intensified by the Ethiopian music. I loved the medieval-style artwork on the walls, and the lampshades made from giant, colourful, inverted cloth umbrellas, as well as the curly Ethiopian writing everywhere (there&#8217;s a basic phrasebook painted on the bar). </p>
<p>The restaurant doesn&#8217;t have tables, it has baskets. Giant, conical baskets with a wide, flat top attached, just the right size for the huge plate which feeds all four of the diners at once, and which you huddle around on the low, cushioned, carved, wooden chairs. The giant plate is simply the base for the giant sourdough pancake which covers it, and onto which the different dishes are tipped in little piles from the small pottery bowls in which they are served. You are given another basket filled with what we inevitably christened &#8220;bandages&#8221; &#8211; strips of pancake rolled neatly into a roll. You tear off a piece about 5-6cm square, and you use it to swoop down on bits of the stew-styled dishes and pop them into your mouth without actually getting any on your fingers. It&#8217;s surprisingly intuitive; there&#8217;s something hard-wired about eating like this, I found I was doing it automatically without even thinking about it. It&#8217;s also very liberating to feel that the eating-with-your-hands thing is not only permitted, it&#8217;s the only way = they don&#8217;t bring utensils. And they wash your hands for you before and after eating. It makes you realise what an enormously wide range of behaviour is actually covered by the concept of &#8220;civilised&#8221;.</p>
<p>The food itself is lovely &#8211; spicy, occasionally with a bite to it, but with a wonderful and distinctive balance of spices and flavours, heavy on the garlic, ginger, turmeric and cardamom. A lot of the dishes rely on <i>berbere</i>, or on a spicy clarified butter thing called <i>kibe</i>. We went for the set menu, which gives you starter, mains with 8 dishes and dessert with coffee or tea. The format is stew rather than large chunks of meat, and I am very happy to report that the Ethiopian word for stew appears to be <i>wot</i> (a stirfy is <i>tibs</i>). It made a welcome distraction from the inevitable and ongoing attempt not to make lame and offensive jokes about starving Ethiopians. </p>
<p>The starter came on a pancake which seemed to have been spiced and oiled and baked in the oven, so it was crispy &#8211; a bit like a cross between a pancake and a pappadom. No bandages with this &#8211; you break off chunks of the crispy pancake and dip them in the spicy lentil dip, or the spinach/cheese one. The lentils were the winner here &#8211; smooth and bitey and piquant. But I could cheerfully have eaten the pancake without any accompaniment at all. We flattened it, and wiped out the dip bowls with our fingers. (&#8220;We&#8221; here is Jo and me, who seem to be particularly uninhibited with this sort of thing).</p>
<p>The main course gave us a very spicy beef stew, a very good lamb one, something flavourful with slightly chewy prawns, and an absolute winner of a slow-cooked chicken thing, rich and dark and flavoured with, I think, lime juice as well as the spices. There was another spicy lentil sauce thing, a sort of tomato/onion salady side dish, and a wonderful spinach conglomeration, not to mention the sweetcorn mix and some random carrot/pumpkin bits around the side. Possibly a garnish. We ate it anyway. We also ordered an extra to the set meal, a helping of something called <i>kitfo</i>, which is the Ethiopian equivalent of steak tartare &#8211; very finely ground beef with spices and chilli, almost a paste, and incredibly good. I found it easier to eat large quantities of this than I usually do with tartare, which I enjoy but can&#8217;t take beyond about three mouthfuls. While we all had favourites here  (mine were the chicken and the spinach), they were all good &#8211; similar stews in style, but with enough variation of flavour and spicing that they weren&#8217;t in any way monotonous. The little bits of pancake with every mouthful also mean that you&#8217;re getting a fair whack of carbohydrate, and you end up feeling <i>very full</i>.</p>
<p>Dessert was a bit arbitrary, slightly leathery baklava or berries with ice-cream, and a bit of a let-down in that it didn&#8217;t continue the authentic Ethiopian theme (the nice waiter did apologise for this, and inform us that Ethiopian meals don&#8217;t really do dessert). But the coffee was presented in a beautiful silver pot with little china handle-less cups, accompanied by the aforementioned incense, and the tea I ordered (I&#8217;ve given up on coffee, the heartburn isn&#8217;t worth it) was flavoured with cloves and honey and was absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>The overall vibe and feel here really are great. The staff are also lovely &#8211; cheerful and attentive and with a slightly amateur touch which really fits with the ambience. (I think a lot of them are also Ethiopian, which means it&#8217;s sometimes a little difficult to understand them through the unfamiliar accent). We brought a bottle of wine (Australian cabernet courtesy of Eckie, perfect for the meat-heavy meal), but the second bottle off the wine list was inexpensive, and there&#8217;s a fair choice. It was a lovely evening all round, comfortable and flavourful and a bit different.</p>
<p>On the Famous Jo scale:<br />
<b>Atmosphere:</b> 9 / 10 (even with the stair problem, the vibe is lovely)<br />
<b>Staff:</b> 8 / 10 (very sweet, beaming, warm)<br />
<b>Service:</b>7 / 10 (can be a little slow at times)<br />
<b>Food:</b> 8.5/ 10 (lovely flavours within its slightly limited range)<br />
<b>Value for money:</b> 8.5 / 10 (really not expensive given the experience and the size of the meal)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ayiee, it has been way too long, and my knuckles need rapping.</p>
<p>I took the crew to Noordhoek, to finally try the Foodbarn, which is done by that guy who did that thing (guy &#8211; Franck Dangereux*, thing = La Colombe). The idea is that it&#8217;s wonderful food in a comfortable environment, a little less pretentious than the high-food places but not compromising on quality. On the whole, they succeed beautifully and it was a lovely outing.</p>
<p>The setting is brilliant &#8211; I&#8217;d like to go back for lunch to have a better feel. The little farm village is quaint, there are few streetlights on the way there (almost missed that turn), and the barn itself (and it is a barn, very nicely converted) is beautifully decorated (I liked the fake-window mirrors, and spoons in windows. I think.). There is an upstairs area, where we were seated, up a very narrow staircase that gives credit to the waiters.</p>
<p>The service was great &#8211; chatty, informal, helpful and interesting. If a little too busy &#8211; the restaurant was full and sometimes it was difficult to find our waitress who did the whole upstairs area by herself. But she was very nice when found, and overall a good experience on the service.</p>
<p>The food is interesting. They have at least 2 menus &#8211; the a la carte and the Bistro (there is also a Degustation menu none of tried) . The Bistro is a set price menu with a number of courses for a fixed price (R185 for 3 courses if memory serves) which is a fantastic price. I had that, while everyone else had the a la carte. This created a strange discrepancy on the table &#8211; a lot of the Bistro dishes were almost exactly the same as the a la carte ones, but slightly smaller and lacking one or two ingredients (prawns, or truffles). They both worked, and I see the point of the smaller courses (I had room for desert), but I did feel like a poor cousin a little and would recommend everyone does one menu or the other together to avoid this subtle feeling of discrimination.</p>
<p>The food was excellent &#8211; I had:</p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Fresh fish tartare with lemon and chives, served on avo pulp with aioli, finished with minute fried curried calamari</div>
<div>
<div>Rack of  lamb roasted in a mustard and bread crust, served with a tomato and olive tart “Tatin” , finished with a rich garlic jus</div>
<div>and something for desert that I have unfortunately forgotten (or they&#8217;ve changed the menu since none of the options on the website look familiar).</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>The fish was wonderful, very fresh and interesting flavours. The &#8220;grown up&#8221; a la carte version had extra prawns, which weren&#8217;t necessary in my view, but I didn&#8217;t get to taste Eckie&#8217;s so may be wrong! The lamb was nice &#8211; the truffle version on the other menu was much better (Jess had that) and Steve&#8217;s steak was also nice, but in the end I felt there was too much &#8220;brown gravy&#8221; type of tastes in the mains and not enough distinctive flavours.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>On the whole, I really like the place. Will definitely go back. Worth exploring the Bistro menu but don&#8217;t let others show you up with the a la carte. Lunch needs to be tried. On the negative side, a little too busy and while the flavours are lovely, I was missing that spark of genius that combines unexpected flavours into taste explosions (TM) &#8211; but that is setting the bar very high.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8/10 (would be 9/10 if it were slightly less busy/crowded)</div>
<div><strong>Staff</strong>: 9/10 (intelligent, informed, friendly)</div>
<div><strong>Service</strong>: 6/10 (lovely and friendly but need one or two more!)</div>
<div><strong>Food</strong>: 8/10 (excellent)</div>
<div><strong>Value for money</strong>: 9/10 for the bistro, 7/10 for the a la carte.</div>
<p>*Dangereux? really? Life&#8217;s not fair when other people have such awesome names.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Right, so for the purposes of this review of Eckhard&#8217;s choice, the part of Eckhard will be played by Jessica. Please imagine this entire review read in a hammy German accent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theroundhouserestaurant.com/home.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theroundhouserestaurant.com/home.html', 'The Roundhouse']);" >The Roundhouse</a>  is a national monument dating back to the eighteenth century; it&#8217;s a quaintly circular building perched up on the hill above Camps Bay, with a spectacular view over the bay, the hillside and the sunset. It&#8217;s also the most upmarket and expensive place we&#8217;ve eaten yet, which means that this won&#8217;t so much be a review as an extended meditation on the nature of Value and Service in the Modern Restaurant. We had a fabulous evening.</p>
<p>It starts well because they reserve parking for their guests, and offer to re-park your car for you if you didn&#8217;t stop to enquire about the reserved parking and parked all the way down the hill. There&#8217;s a small waiterly phalanx on the front steps, including one of the evening&#8217;s hosts: you are welcomed, your reservation confirmed apparently from memory, and are ushered into the rather charming curved-walled, wooden-floored restaurant to be given a table right next to the window and the view. Everything&#8217;s white linen and solid silver cutlery, but they&#8217;ve left what could quite possibly be several hundred years worth of graffiti scratched into the windows, so the whole thing has an air of slightly raffish character.  Your jackets are hung up for you. (I love that. It&#8217;s such a personal touch). They suggest aperitifs, and bring you incredibly tall glasses of gin and tonic, filled with ice. The host introduces himself, and the menu, which is full of fascinating flavour combinations &#8211; foie gras and mackerel, quail with artichokes, hake with roasted peppers and fennel.</p>
<p>The service in this place is, quite simply, superb. There&#8217;s a very high ratio of waiters to guests, and they seem to stagger the arrivals of the guests deliberately, so each arrival is a bit of a production. They passed the water test with flying colours &#8211; it arrives in a lovely old silver jug, and your glasses are filled attentively. If you leave the table, someone folds your napkin. The wait-staff drift around in the middle distance, working in well-coordinated teams to bring everyone&#8217;s meal to the table in one fell swoop; they synchronise movements by eyebrow semaphore and, apparently, telepathy. The waiter wanted us to order four courses at once, we wanted to do two first and then the next two; the host was there in seconds to graciously permit the deviation. They are very, very good at reacting positively to exceptions.</p>
<p>The menu is set out in four courses &#8211; starter, fish, mains, dessert, with three or four options in each &#8211; but you pay for either four or five courses, and can pick from wherever you like. (Jo, predictably, had steak for dessert again, which cracked up the waiter rather gratifyingly). You can also do the wine-pairing option for an additional charge.  The charge is not small: R395 for four courses without wine, R595 for the same with wine. It&#8217;s inevitable that we&#8217;d compare this with Overture, who still come out ahead &#8211; food slightly better, prices lower, and, most importantly, larger portion sizes. The Roundhouse is <i>very</i> nouvelle; when the first course came out, I was conscious of a sinking feeling, looking at the tiny, arty island of food in the middle of the huge plate &#8211; it seemed entirely disproportionate given the cost of the evening. The wine portions are likewise small, less than half a glass, although beautifully served in individual glass decanters. It&#8217;s a testament to the quality of the food, service and ambience that we ended up leaving feeling absolutely the reverse of taken for a ride.</p>
<p>So, first course stv and I both had the ricotta cannelloni with pickled beets, which was unusual and really excellent &#8211; strong beet flavour and creaminess enhanced with a balsamic jelly reduction which was amazing and intense. (The ros&eacute; which went with it was perfectly chosen to complement it). Jo and Eckie had the foie gras and smoked mackerel terrine, a slightly bizarre combination which worked absolutely beautifully, and was served with (fairly minute portions of) octopus and toasted brioche, which, yum. The second course was slightly more substantial; my roasted cob with a chorizo and mussel veloute came with mashed potatoes, and was very good and surprisingly like a creamy bouillabaisse in flavour. (Eckhard also had this, as I recollect). Steve had the hake with roasted peppers, which I think was the winner in this course &#8211; lovely balance of flavours, the strong peppers very interesting with the more delicate fish. Jo went, I think, for the crayfish with smoked pork trotter and broad bean salad, and I am completely unable to remember what that was like, owing, I suspect, to flavour overload.</p>
<p>For third course, Jo and Eckie tried the lamb&#8217;s brain/tongue/cheek combination, daring things that they are. The waiter was not actually significantly helpful with this, suggesting that the lamb&#8217;s brain was &#8220;chewy&#8221;, whereas Jo and Eckie were more inclined to describe it as &#8220;not chewy&#8221;. The tongue was excellent, though, and the celeriac pur&eacute;e a surprising but apt accompaniment. I had slow-cooked quail with artichokes (yum! I love artichokes, these were tiny and tender and intense) and asparagus, and a rather vivid sherry-based jus. I can&#8217;t remember what Steve had &#8211; the same? Losing track.</p>
<p>Dessert was good &#8211; Eckhard had a baked camembert which he didn&#8217;t say much about other than that it was good; Steve&#8217;s chocolate fondant with honey ginger ice cream was the clear winner. I had a raspberry souffl&eacute;: it&#8217;s served all hot from the kitchen, and the waiter cuts a cross in the top and inserts a scoop of pistachio ice-cream. It was very good, moist and fluffy and seriously raspberryish, but a little too sweet for my taste. Should have had the chocolate. Jo had, as aforementioned, beef with a parsnip pur&eacute;, which I think was good but not spectacular.</p>
<p>I think this could have been a disaster in the legendary mould of Aubergine, except for three things. (Apart from the beautiful setting, which is On Tap courtesy of Cape Town, and thus slightly cheating). One, we were expecting the steep price, and had decided to go for it anyway: we were in the mood to immerse ourselves in that upmarket atmosphere. Their web information and phone booking process are very good at making perfectly explicit exactly what you&#8217;re getting into. Two, they really do it very well. Their service is immaculate: attentive, intelligent, alert but not actually too intrusive, and you end up feeling enormously well cared for. The food is beautifully prepared and served, rife with fascinating flavour combinations: the portion size ends up nicely-judged in a four-course meal so you&#8217;re satisfied by the end, but not overstuffed. I mean, we have no problem with overstuffed, but occasionally an elegant sufficiency is a nice change. Three, they do it with a refreshing, charming and rather warm-hearted complete lack of pretension. I was struck by the good humour of the staff &#8211; they seem to genuinely enjoy working here, and interacting with their clients. There was none of that offended, rather rigid and slightly stultifying thing Aubergine did to us which basically made it an awful evening.</p>
<p>So, on the Patented Jo Scale:<br />
<b>Atmosphere:</b> 9 / 10 (classic high-end dining with a particular warmth, and a really lovely setting)<br />
<b>Staff:</b> 8 / 10 (intelligent, good-humoured, good at their jobs)<br />
<b>Service:</b> 9 / 10 (It&#8217;s a whole ethos of service, and it shows)<br />
<b>Food:</b> 7.5/ 10 (Good, interesting, occasionally exciting, slightly variable in quality)<br />
<b>Value for money:</b> 7 / 10 (a heavy blow to the wallet almost completely justified by the experience)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d go there again in a heartbeat, supposing I had a lot of money and a really spectacularly important occasion to celebrate. But I think I&#8217;d go to Overture first. </p>

		<p>(preamble follows. <a href="#theactualsaltreview">skip to the actual review</a>)<br />
Ahem.<br />
I had a bit of a busy week last week, so I left my Crack Prep a little late. However, by the Wednesday I had fixed a cool sounding place. It didn&#8217;t look promising, though: only little bits of scattered info over the web.<br />
I tried calling on Wednesday, but no dice. I tried again on Thursday, but still no dice (not even a D4).<br />
So I went to the actual location on Friday morning.<br />
Outdoor decor still there, but very much Not A Restaurant. More of a student digs laundry. Thing.</p>
<p>So, Friday afternoon I started a new fork of research and settled on the lovely looking, friend-recommended, mostly Thai, <a href="http://www.kitima.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kitima.co.za/', 'Kitima']);" >Kitima</a>.<br />
They were fully booked. Gah!<br />
Not that surprising, calling at 6pm on a Friday night for a 7pm table, but still: gah!<br />
Research prong three lead to <a href="http://www.newmarkhotels.com/newmark/salt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newmarkhotels.com/newmark/salt/', 'Salt']);" >Salt</a> at the <a href="http://www.newmarkhotels.com/newmark/ambassador/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newmarkhotels.com/newmark/ambassador/', 'Ambassador Hotel']);" >Ambassador Hotel</a>., which I booked with no problems.<br />
Disaster averted &#8211; huzzah!</p>
<h2 id="theactualsaltreview">The Actual Review</h2>
<p>We had a bit of an adventure finding the place (not very clearly marked (at night) from the Camps Bay side, and the GPS thingy had it in the wrong place), but initial impressions were good. Very shiny hotel, and the restaurant was decked out very nicely, and not very hotel-restaurant-like at all (unlike some places, *stares at <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/05/31/myoga-review/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/05/31/myoga-review/', 'Myoga']);" >Myoga</a>*). It felt like a proper restaurant, rather than something tacked on to the hotel.<br />
One wall of the restaurant is floor-to-ceiling windows offering a fantastic view. Alas, not so much for us, since we arrived just past dusk. Note to self: go there for lunch.</p>
<p>The waiter passed the water test with flying colours, although he needed a bit of a nudge for refills.<br />
Bonus points for decanting the bottle of red we had with us: classy.</p>
<p>I had the slightly clever idea of writing stuff down this time, so as not to forget what we all had.</p>
<h3>Starters</h3>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> partially de boned herb stuffed quail with a fricassee of crayfish, corn &#038; shimeji mushrooms<br />
<strong>Jo:</strong> terrine game and foie gras with sauce gribiche, apple chutney &#038; toasted Challah<br />
<strong>Jess:</strong> rillette of pork with apple puree &#038; bagel chip<br />
<strong>Eck:</strong> rillette of pork with apple puree &#038; bagel chip</p>
<p>All were <em>excellent</em>. That is all. :)</p>
<h3>Mains</h3>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> springbok loin with creamy white cabbage, confit potato and cherry jus<br />
<strong>Jo:</strong> selection of cape fish &#038; shellfish with a tomato &#038; saffron broth &#038; rouille toast<br />
<strong>Jess:</strong> confit duck leg with miso broth, wilted greens and crisp coriander dressed salad<br />
<strong>Eck:</strong> deboned lamb neck with a herb crust , creamy barley, baby onion &#038; a reduced braising liquid </p>
<p>Every dish was great, but I was particularly fond of my bokkie: perfectly pink.<br />
Jo&#8217;s soupy affair was lovely and delicate, and Jess&#8217;s Asian-y duck was cracking.</p>
<h3>Dessert</h3>
<p>A partially shared affair. The table had:<br />
dark chocolate fondant with port syrup &#038; mint ice cream<br />
and<br />
tonka bean tiramisu parfait serve with espresso espuma &#038; tuille.<br />
The choccy managed to be rich and tasty without being thick and hard-going, like dark C desserts can often be, and the mint ice cream was lovely.<br />
Espresso espuma: funny looking, but tasty.</p>
<h3>Scores on the doors</h3>
<p>Overall, an excellent experience &#8211; consistently high quality food in a very pleasant environment.<br />
We like!<br />
I will try to mark &#8220;hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Atmosphere: 8 / 10 (Reminded me a bit of <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/09/06/ginja/#comments" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/09/06/ginja/#comments', 'Ginja']);" >Ginja</a>. A bit trendy, but no pretentious with it).<br />
Staff: 7 / 10 (Polite, pleasant, smart)<br />
Service: 6 / 10 (Professional, but a little inattentive)<br />
Food: 9 / 10 (The food was in the nouveau style, but the portions were quite generous &#8211; win!)<br />
Value for money: 8 / 10 (On a par with other places with similar offerings, but bigger bang for your buck)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Various inflictions and deflections, like illness and overseas trips, have delayed August&#8217;s Salty Cracker expedition, which consequently took place on Friday night. I chose Bizerca, lured by the online reviews which praised its warmth, unpretentiousness and good food as well as by the magical combinations of &#8220;French&#8221;, &#8220;fusion&#8221; and &#8220;bistro&#8221;, and wow was it worth the wait. We really like this place. We had a lovely evening, and there was an indecorous level of &#8220;oohing&#8221; and &#8220;aahing&#8221; over the food.</p>
<p>I have to say, at first glance it doesn&#8217;t look promising; the plastic chairs, glass walls, art deco plastic tables and eye-watering monochrome swirls over the bar all scream &#8220;trendoid!&#8221;, which in our experience is not often synonomous with good food. However, the potentially plastic ambience is warmed and redeemed by the service , which is headed by the lovely, chatty, arm-patty wife of the cook, and by the little touches &#8211; the menu being carried around on giant chalkboards, the fact that they have a cupboard for your coats. The printed menu is tiny, the daily-changing chalkboard one huge, which strikes me as the right balance for seasonal and inventive freshness; the dishes have a high proportion of interesting ingredients and combinations, not your standard nouvelle/fusion stuff. One of those menus where it&#8217;s really difficult to choose, and as soon as you&#8217;ve ordered you immediately wish you&#8217;d ordered something else, because it all looks so good.</p>
<p>We really liked the owner-lady: she explained the specials to us, laughed at the usual Salty Cracker silliness, and was very amenable to the idea that we might suddenly decide to order the special apple tart, which needs a 45-minute lead time, by semaphore. We spent the rest of the evening carefully not raising our hands above shoulder level, just in case dessert arrived as seventeen accidental apple pies we&#8217;d then have to eat. The waiters passed the Water Test quite adequately &#8211; a slightly raised eyebrow when we eschewed bottled water, but large glasses of tap water were provided as requested, and topped up if requested. (The table was a bit small for a jug, precluding our usual technique of the Large Jug). Our wine glasses were promptly filled. And their bread is simply wonderful &#8211; hot, crusty, brown, a light, dense crumb &#8211; perfect.</p>
<p>The &#8220;wow&#8221; started with the starters. I had a venison pâté/duck rilette combo, which was good, solid flavours, nicely prepared, but was raised to sublime levels with a sort of spicy relish thing, with I think cumin seeds in it &#8211; perfectly complementary flavours. (I&#8217;m kicking myself that I didn&#8217;t have a look at their home-made jams). Jo had a seared salami starter with peas, which is quite unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen on a French fusion menu, and was wonderful and slightly startling. Stv&#8217;s raw fish whatever-it-was came as a mould, and was exquisitely flavoured, possibly the winner of the starter courses (what was it, stvil? I can&#8217;t remember). Eckhard had the pork belly starter, which was simply evil. In a good way. The starter course was accompanied by a lot of &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aah&#8221; and swapping of forks &#8211; the latter is a standard Salty Cracker practice, to the joy and/or despair of the restaurants, but the enthusiasm was damned well earned.</p>
<p>The starters arrived  very promptly, the mains less so, which was probably our fault for making noises about not wanting the evening to be over too quickly. (Nice owner lady: &#8220;You can stay here until 3am as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I&#8217;ve told the staff to delay your mains a bit.&#8221;) Jo and Eckie both had bouillabaise, which looked amazing &#8211; a rich creamy sauce rather than the usual clear soup, but intensely flavoured, served with croutons and a garlic aioli. Stv had something game-steaky? (memory goes&#8230;) It was excellent, although I can&#8217;t remember the trimmings. I had a braised shoulder of veal, amazingly tender, with some kind of incredibly intense reduction whose wonderful flavour I couldn&#8217;t identify, and parsnips, which I adore and which far too few restaurants cook.</p>
<p>These are not nouvelle portions, which is not a trivial issue given the richness of the food. We were all pretty much groaning by the end of it, and I was the only one who ventured into dessert, on the strict understanding that Jo ate half, when everyone else had tea and coffee.  Liquid-centred hot chocolate pudding, white chocolate crème brûlée, and a sort of intense berry sorbet thing which was absolutely essential in order to survive the chocolate, which was <em>savage</em>, again in a good way. I need to learn how to make this chocolate thing, it was delectable &#8211; rather like an inverted self-saucing pudding, but with very high quality dark chocolate and no restraint whatsoever.</p>
<p>The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, but by the time we left &#8211; for which read &#8220;rolled out the door, groaning&#8221; &#8211; it had filled up with a very lively, chatty, happy crowd. It&#8217;s quite noisy, but not intrusively so &#8211; the vibe is actually lovely. The service slows down a bit as the room fills up, understandably enough, but never to the point of being annoying, and the staff are smiley and pleasant. Also, parking is easy, lots around the corner with a car-guard. Which is fortunate, because we were too full to walk far.</p>
<p>It was a lovely evening, we like this place. On the Patent Jo Scale:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 9 / 10 (unexpectedly warm and cosy given the trendoid tendencies)<br />
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (Cheerful, attentive, unobtrusive.)<br />
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (a bit variable, slowed down as the place filled up)<br />
<strong>Food</strong>: 9 / 10 (Yum.)<br />
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 9 / 10 (really very reasonable prices for such carefully-prepared, creative dishes)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oh dear, it has been a while. So far back that I only have general impressions left and few specifics. I will do my best, anyway.</p>
<p>The general feeling was positive &#8211; good ambiance, good service, good food. However, it was priced like an Overture but really was more of an upmarket Italian/steak place and not quite as inventive as I expected. More detail:</p>
<p>Food: *faint memories*&#8230; there was meat, and there was things-with-sauce. The meat was not outstanding &#8211; it was good but not brilliant, and not good enough to be the &#8220;speciality of the house&#8221;. The things-with-sauce &#8211; Pork, I think, and was it springbok or osso buco? Or springbok osso buco. It was very very good, in a home-cooked goodness kind of way (large portions, rich sauces), which is slightly out of kilt with the ver&#8217; posh vibe, but that&#8217;s no reason for complaint. The carpaccios (which have their own section of the menu) were good, but not amazing, and the steak tartare, which I can&#8217;t resist, was not as good as I like it &#8211; the balance of condiments was not right.</p>
<p>Service: Excellent if occasionally slightly scarce. The bread basket at start was really interesting with all sorts of different home-baked things. Service highlight: Deliberating over desert, some of the party eventually ordered (yummy) things, and the waiter turned to me. &#8220;Nothing for me&#8221;, I said, until he turned away and was walking off. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; I called. &#8220;A SPOON.&#8221; He nearly keeled over giggling. I like cracking waiters up.</p>
<p>Ambiance: Lovely decor, very pleasant, light and modern. All works together.</p>
<p>Value for money: Slightly too pricey for its offering. Only one bottle of corkage allowed &#8211; but communicated nicely so we let it slip.</p>
<p>Altogether: It was nice, but won&#8217;t become a regular.</p>
<p>Food: 7</p>
<p>Ambiance: 8</p>
<p>Service: 8</p>
<p>Value for money: 6</p>
