				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few Fridays ago, the new (and some might say improved) Crackernaut roster went down into the deep south of (the republic of) Hout Bay for some Pacific Rim cuisine at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cheyneshoutbay">Cheyne&#8217;s</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/cheyne_reaction">@cheyne_reaction</a> on the Twitters). Trivia factoid: this was only <a href="https://saltycracker.co.za/category/outings/hout-bay/">our second Cracker in Hout Bay</a>. (Also: no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/">Jaegers or Kaiju</a> were spotted, in case you were wondering.)</p>
<h2 id="theyay">The Yay</h2>
<p>The food was excellent all round. The menu is tapas-style and is divided into Sea, Land, Earth, and (erm) Happy Endings. We had a good mix of animals and vegetables, and pretty much every dish was delicious. There was a wide range of flavours and styles and it tickled all my Eastern bells.</p>
<p><a href="https://saltycracker.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-07-20.45.31.jpg"><img src="https://saltycracker.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-07-20.45.31-225x300.jpg" alt="2014-11-07 20.45.31" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-733" /></a><a href="https://saltycracker.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-07-20.49.44.jpg"><img src="https://saltycracker.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-07-20.49.44-225x300.jpg" alt="2014-11-07 20.49.44" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-734" /></a></p>
<p>The decor is also worth a mention: slightly odd, but very groovy prints of graffiti-as-art cover the walls and give the place an interesting feel. Our table was a nice big, solid, bit of wood, but it did make us feel like we were sitting quite far away from each other.</p>
<p>The service was really good, but we kept having odd not-actual-misunderstandings with our waiter. It often wasn&#8217;t clear that he had got what we said and that all was good. But the right food and drinks kept coming out, so we were happy.</p>
<h2 id="theboo">The Boo</h2>
<p>After a couple of plates we started spotting some patterns. While it was beautifully presented, the food started to look a bit similar. The setting for it, I mean: every dish came in the same style: perched on a black slate tile, with little blobs of Kewpie mayo and little hills of (admittedly nommy) kimchi on. A minor quibble to be sure, but a bit odd.</p>
<h2 id="insummerysummary">In summery summary</h2>
<p>Next time I&#8217;m out that way again, it will definitely be high on my list as somewhere to go, but I suspect I wouldn&#8217;t make the trip out just to go and eat there. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite being in a hotel (the <a href="http://www.houtbaymanor.com">Hout Bay Manor</a>) I though <a href="http://www.houtbaymanor.com/menu">Pure looked promising</a>: lovely decor, interesting sounding food. Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>As a quick aside: the place is quiet hard to find at night. The road leading up to HBM isn&#8217;t signposted; the entrance gate thing is big and labelled, but isn&#8217;t lit. So we missed it the first time. Ahem.</p>
<p>Where Pure dropped points was staff and service: most of the waiting staff were polite, but curt with it, and had no warmth. Compare this to somewhere like <a href="https://saltycracker.co.za/2010/11/02/the-roundhouse-2/">the Roundhouse</a> (extremely formal and fancy, but also very friendly) or (Crackernaut winningest hearth-throb) Overture and the comparison is quite unfavourable. They also weren&#8217;t knowledgable about the food: Jess&#8217;s quite tasty pureed beetroot soup with roast garlic was described as &#8220;beet soup *frown*&#8221;; Jo asked about pasta portion sizes as she wanted one for a starter, was told they were quite large, and got three small ravioli; there was &#8220;a misprint&#8221; on the menu that meant taking three scoops of the same ice cream as a dish cost more than taking three scoops separately, which they had to discuss with the chef to find out.</p>
<p>Soon after we sat down, we were greeted by the very cheery Food and Beverage Manager (um&#8230;) Vincent, who wished us happy eating and told us not to hesitate to give him any feedback. This was nice. Alas, we never saw him again.</p>
<p>We Crackerlngs like to take wine with us to restaurants. It&#8217;s not so much that we&#8217;re cheap: more that restaurants charge a ridiculous mark up on their wine. We took a pretty fancy bottle of red that we&#8217;d been saving and the (grouchy) waitress opened it for us. She came back about five minutes later and told me that they were charging corkage of R80 (burn!). That&#8217;s a bit ridiculous compared to other spots in Cape Town, and it would have been better to have told us <em>before</em> they opened the bottle. It&#8217;s interesting though that their web site says &#8220;<a href="http://www.houtbaymanor.com/winelist">As we have a extensive wine list we have a NO Corkage Policy at Pure.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The menu is a bit schizophrenic. It&#8217;s part bistro, part steakhouse, but doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark for either. The scores, then.</p>
