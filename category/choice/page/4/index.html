<div class="entry-content">
<p>Let us say, just to start with, that there&#8217;s absolutely nothing wrong with a steakhouse. A steakhouse is a lovesome thing, God wot. This whole Salty Cracker lark started with a steakhouse, the Hussar, and it&#8217;s still a favourite haunt. A steakhouse is perfectly capable of offering a superlative experience of its kind, and should be measured not against fancy Frenchy food or nouveau whatsits, but against the Platonic steakhouse ideal, redolent of warmth, informality, substantial food, lack of pretension, a certain speedy facility in the service, and above all, superlative steak as a centrepiece, a kind of religious icon of carnivorous pleasure. Hussar does it in everything except the service. Nelson&#8217;s Eye sets new heights to the steak bar and vaults them with ease, rendering its lack of actual side-dish accomplishments moot. I personally eat steak about twice a year, but I thoroughly enjoy it &#8211; and the evil chippy trimmings &#8211; when I do. The Evil Landord defaults to the steak-ey with his choices, and it&#8217;s absolutely OK by me.</p>
<p>All that being said, it remains a tragic truth that the Famous Butcher&#8217;s Grill simply doesn&#8217;t deliver. It should have rung warning bells when the Evil Landlord had to undertake a mini epic quest just to track one down &#8211; the branches in the suburbs seem to have closed down in the last year or so, which does not auger a franchise in the bloom of meaty health. The remaining branch is in the Cape Town Lodge, a hotel in the CBD, and even on a Friday night with live music was not a seething locus of steak-guzzling activity.</p>
<p>The ambiance isn&#8217;t bad: it has a reasonable feeling of cosiness, and really quite pervable scrolly brocade designs in the wallpaper and tablecloths. I can&#8217;t think that the live music is a plus, though; it&#8217;s too small a venue for a guitar dude with the amp cranked up high, and it was frankly intrusive. (He didn&#8217;t have a bad voice and the music was recognisable 70s-90s guitar pop, but reinterpretations of Chris Rea do not aid my digestion.) It also helps to be given a small, complimentary bowl of perfectly adequate leek-and-potato soup as a welcome and a talisman against the cold of the evening, which has been a little sharp-tooth-bitey winter recently. The waiter was pleasant, attentive and willing to be amused by the usual Salty Cracker antics; the service is mostly good, and our starters arrived astonishingly quickly. The food, however: the food is &#8230; adequate. Okay, shading down into &#8220;not up to scratch&#8221; in some areas. Mostly as ordered, but in the &#8220;serviceable&#8221; category rather than even the &#8220;good&#8221;. Nothing inedible, but nothing really exciting.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t blown away by the starter offerings, but most of the usual suspects are there; deep-fried Camembert, calamari, the standard steakhouse fare. (I was deeply amused to see that they advertise a basket-of-blitong starter as &#8220;African Sushi&#8221;). Often this sort of basic starter off a small menu is done very well at a steakhouse, but my calamari had a rather dry, crumbly breading to it, and wasn&#8217;t exciting for flavour or texture. How difficult is it to spice up a breading? Honestly. Stv and the EL had the Camembert, fairly inevitably, which seemed to be OK &#8211; sufficiently gloopy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and Stv managed to polish off the whole thing, which is something of a testament given his tendency to shrivel up and die when overly cheesed. Jo&#8217;s Avocado Ritz was a bit odd &#8211; piles of lettuce and a seafood mayonnaise pile under which some lonely avocado bits presumably lurked. She&#8217;ll have to weigh in on how it actually tasted, but it looked like very 50s cuisine to me.</p>
<p>We all had steak &#8211; T-bone, rump, fillet medallions. My medallions were nicely tender, cooked in brandy with a peppercorn sauce which was rather good; the grade of meat itself was excellent, and the specified &#8220;rare&#8221; actually achieved, although to the bleu end of the spectrum rather than the medium. (And, no, this isn&#8217;t because of all the vampire tv lately: I&#8217;ve always liked my steak rare. I only have it every six months or so, but when I do I crave it bloody). The only problem was that they don&#8217;t actually sear the outside properly, which means it was a sort of grey rather than being grilled to brown; in fact, this seems to have been a feature of all the steaks for the evening, rather a travesty given the &#8220;grill&#8221; delineation. Also, I seem to have got lucky with the fillet: Jo said her rump was tough, the EL reported his &#8220;stringy around the edges&#8221;, and Stv&#8217;s T-bone wasn&#8217;t properly cooked next to the bone despite a request for &#8220;medium rare&#8221;. The side dishes were perfectly arb as well as perfectly carb &#8211; mounds of bland mashed potato, undistinguished chips, the usual butternut/creamed spinach duo in the name of vitamins. (And what&#8217;s with that? As the EL pointed out at the time, all steakhouses seem to default to those two vegetables, probably because they&#8217;re easy to produce as large vats of glop. Or because there are deep underlying signifiers which one of these fine days I shall deconstruct).</p>
<p>All this being the case, it&#8217;s extremely lucky the EL found four hitherto unsuspected remaining bottles of Diemersfontein Pinotage under his bed, and brought two of them along; we polished them off, and it made up for a lot. We ended up full, but curiously unsatisfied; we didn&#8217;t bother to stay for dessert.</p>
<p>I fear that, on the Patented SC Scale, the Famous Butcher&#8217;s Grill is not that famous. The Judge from Really Bloody Steak awards the following:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 6 / 10 (pleasant enough setting, points docked for inappropriate loud music)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (Cheerful, attentive, vanished a couple of times and had to be extracted with forceps by the desk person.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (quick to very quick, needed some prompting for water refills and wine-opening)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 6 / 10 (meh. Could have been worse.)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 6 / 10 (really would like to see more bang for my buck)</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Yet again, I find myself saying &#8220;<a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/07/02/fujiyama-review/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/07/02/fujiyama-review/', 'This is not a review of Kubo’s Little Japan on Riebeek St in town']);">This is not a review of Kubo’s Little Japan on Riebeek St in town</a>&#8220;.<br/>
It is however a review of the slightly oddly named Sushi Master on Riebeek St in town, which is what Kubo&#8217;s has become. A fine Korean gentleman by the name of Jung has taken over Kubo&#8217;s old spot, including (it seems) the menu. This is good since I was aiming for Japanese, not Korean, food.</p>
<p>[Pssst! Looking for the short version? It&#8217;s here: &#8220;cheap, good, Japanese food, despite the change of hands&#8221;]</p>
<h3>Boom, Shake, Shake, Shake The Room</h3>
<p>The evening did not get off to an auspicious start. The Boom Boom Shakalak bar above was quiet, but not quiet. It was fairly empty (quiet), but they seemed to be testing the maximum volume of their speakers (not quiet). Well, I whine, but it wasn&#8217;t exactly deafening. It did make for an interesting &#8220;mix&#8221; of their boomboom and Kubo / Sushi Master&#8217;s selection (of Richard Clayderman, The Magical Sound of the Pan Pipes, and assorted authentic eastern tunes). I felt The Fear that I&#8217;d picked a clanger for Cracker. Luckily this was not to be the case.</p>
<p>The decor was classic. Classic in the sense of horrible kitsch that sort of works, a la Minato&#8217;s.<br/>
We popped open one of our two bottles of vino (R15 corkage, btw. R15! Stick that in your pretentious pipe and smoke it, Aubergine! (Yes, still bitter about that.)) and perused the menu. Cheap! Interesting! Japanese!</p>
<h3>And So It Begins&#8230;</h3>
<p>We shared two plates of mixed tempura (prawns, calamari, veggies) for starters. Tasty! This was definitely Tempura Done Right and made me very happy. Bubbly, light, crispy batter, tasty sauce accompaniment. I could probably have handled another few pieces, but they weren&#8217;t stingy portions.</p>
<h3>The Mains Event</h3>
<p>For mains, we had a veritable 食べ放題 of goodies: beef tataki<sup>1</sup> with ponzu sauce; beef teppanyaki<sup>2</sup>; Chicken Kara-age<sup>3</sup>; chicken and veggies noodles fry-up; roast salmon belly; chawan mushi<sup>4</sup>. All the nosh was good, but stars for me were the beef tataki (pink!) and the salmon (pink!). Nom (pink!)!</p>
<h3>The Dessert Of The Real</h3>
<p>Then, unusually for Cracker, we had dessert. Bar one tempura and ice cream. So crazy it works.<br/>
Tasty tiny treat to round off the meal. Eck had his own, the J, J, S threesome shared two.</p>
<h3>Conclusions, Thoughts, Comments</h3>
<p>The total was R600, including a generous tip, which seems very reasonable given that we ate loads.<br/>
Certainly cheaper than lots of previous Crackers.</p>
<p>Alas, I fear that the Master of Sushi may not last. Part of it is that it&#8217;s cheap. And small. Both of these I see as plus points as a patron, but it must make it more difficult to make money. A more pertinent part is that we were the only people present. From 7 to 10pm. On a Saturday night. Oh, as they say, dear. I suspect that Kubo&#8217;s attracted a very local following that will desert the new look / theme / vibe / owner, given how fickle Cape Town eaters are.</p>
<h3>Patented Jo Scores on the Doors</h3>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 3 / 10 (kitschy decor works, but booming music is distracting. We enjoyed our meal despite it (had rather a jolly time, actually), but it would have much better without.)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 7 / 10 (Nice waitress lady, smiley sushi chef (even though we had none of his wares), very friendly and earnest owner (language barrier made interactions more entertaining / interesting))<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (Not particularly attentive, but easily signal-able given small space, and food came well-paced, as it was ready, piping hot (esp. important for tempura))<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 8 / 10 (Me liked. Interesting, new Japanese food. A bit different to other places which generally serve sushi as their Japanese stuff, or some kind of bastard-love-child-fusion thing which, while tasty, is not really Japanese Food.)<br/>
Value for money: 9 / 10 (Our final bill was low for Cracker, perhaps still a little high in general, but we had <em>lots</em> of nosh for our cash)</p>
<p>Fellow Crack-ees: what was the other category we wanted to add?</p>
<p>________________________________<br/>
1 &#8211; basically very rare, sliced beef. Watching this being cooked was awesome. Big chunk of meat, held in tongs, waved at flame of gas hob. Hypnotic.<br/>
2 &#8211; beef cube stir fry thingy<br/>
3 &#8211; Japanese style fried chicken<br/>
4 &#8211; steam egg custardy thing in a tiny bowl. Um&#8230; <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=chawanmushi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.za/search?q=chawanmushi', 'google it']);">google it</a>!<br/>
5 &#8211; there is no five, you may have noticed. Except that there is because this is it. This is a secret bit. You may have noticed that we had no sushi. A bit odd when going to a place called Sushi Master. Well, since it&#8217;s only really Jo and I who are the sushi monkeys, and that there was so much other interesting stuff to try, and that I&#8217;m on a quest for Japanese food that is not sushi, we decided to forgo said raw fish for that night. Jo and I will return by ourselves, or with other sushi monkeys, and try some then. The menu looked shortish, but with interesting animals. We&#8217;ll be back!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>For someone with an obsessive-compulsive blogging habit, I forget to blog my Salty Cracker choices way too often. Sigh. Sorry. Yindee&#8217;s was a while back now, end of March, which in fact meant the first of April owing to the mad socialising in the previous week. I chose Yindee&#8217;s slightly cautiously, because the First Rule of Salty Cracker Club is Good Food By Strict Rotation of Choice, but the Second Rule is Not Thai, because none of it is ever as good as Thai as cooked by Stv. (The Third Rule is They Must Allow Us To Bring Wine. The Fourth Rule is that Whoever Chooses Also Drives, with corollaries (a) my car is too small so sometimes I drive home for someone else, and (b) Jo Will Drink Lots And Hardly Ever Drive). However, I wrung the admission from my fellow members that (a) Yindee&#8217;s is fun, and (b) we could do Thai as long as it wasn&#8217;t any dish Stv usually cooks. Since this to me means all the crunchy deep-fried starter thingies, for which I cherish an illicit passion without any shame whatsoever, Yindee&#8217;s it was.</p>
<p>I also wanted something not too upmarket for this, because we did another Overture run the weekend before, and trying to be upmarket after Overture is always an anticlimax. One needs distance.  Yindee&#8217;s had exactly the right vibe &#8211; not too expensive, generally relaxed sort of feel, decent food, waiter with a big grin, lots of dark wood in the décor. It all adds up. The major mistake I made, though, was to agree to try out their low-table cushions-on-the-floor room when I booked. It sounded like a fun idea at the time, but I forgot about my knees. It was never quite comfortable, which I found distracted from the experience &#8211; I managed not to break any portion of myself, but there was considerable whale-like floundering in getting up and down. We have now Done This, and don&#8217;t need to repeat it. Chairs are my new religion.</p>
<p>They have a one-bottle-per-table corkage policy, causing the Evil Landlord to fulminate something &#8216;orrible, but in the event their wine list is quite extensive and there are sufficient inexpensive options not to be offensive. (Is it just me, or are CT restaurants limiting corkage bottles more and more often? I blame the recession). Also, jo&amp;stv brought a really good white, although I cannot for the life of me remember which. We did the standard oriental food thing, which was to order one dish each, bung them all in the middle of the table and share, culminating in arguments about who gets the last piece of duck. (Usually me).</p>
<p>Starters were good! fish cake thingies nicely flavourful, slightly standard beef satay and sweetcorn fritters, and <em>really</em> good potato strips in a sesame batter, my favourite from this course. Must try this at home. (I try the sweetcorn fritters at home, frequently, and have to say mine are better, mostly because I can&#8217;t restrain myself from Bunging Extra Stuff In, usually more chilli). We eschewed tempura on the grounds that it isn&#8217;t Thai, although I would have cheerfully suffered the inauthenticity. Deep fried things in batter make me strangely happy.</p>
<p>I chose, of course, duck for mains, crispy deboned duck with a rather delectable tamarind sauce &#8211; yum. The Evil Landlord had seared tuna, which was excellent, in a sort of herb crust. I think Jo had fish of some kind in a garlic and pepper stir fry, yes? also very good. I am totally, utterly and completely unable to remember what Stv ordered. It was also good. There were no actual bad choices here: the mains were better than the starters, I thought, with interesting flavours. The portions are reasonably substantial &#8211; I could have done with marginally more, and certainly more in the way of veggie components to the dishes, but we were all full enough not to want dessert.</p>
<p>This was a good experience, but not a brilliant one &#8211; solid food, nice vibe and setting without being particularly memorable, reasonable service but not outstanding. (Our waiter vanished completely when we wanted to pay him, and had to be summoned from the depths with strange rituals). Yindee&#8217;s bills itself as an &#8220;authentic&#8221; Thai experience, but I fear Stv&#8217;s cooking has spoiled us for that. It pretty much lives up to its cost bracket: I&#8217;d eat here again cheerfully and with enjoyment, but not to mark any special occasion. It certainly doesn&#8217;t trump our benchmark for Mid-Level Eastern Food, which is Jewel Tavern &#8211; flavour, quantity, vibe are all trailing behind the Tavern&#8217;s delirious high. Besides, a Lazy Susan on the table adds bonus style points which are difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>On the Patented Jo Table, the judge from Eastern Knee Troubles offers the following:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8 / 10 (nice try on the low tables, good vibe)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (pleasant, cheerful. Too often Cape Town waiters appear to be confirmed misanthropes.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (occasionally absent/slow, but passed the Water Test with flying colours)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (good but not spectacular)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 8 / 10 (priced unpretentiously and appropriately)</p>

<p>I wanted a comfy, homey, snuggly vibe, with no sign of pretentiousness and giant portions. Check. Sloppy Sam&#8217;s is all those things, delivered with a mediterranean flair and plenty of lamb. Lamb, lamb, wonderful lamb, rolled with garlic on kebab sticks (Jess and Stv), slowly braised into melting goodness (EL), its ribs crisped with garlic and lemon (next time, next time) or in an iraqui abgusht stew with dried limes (yet another visit needed).  Defiantly, I had calamari, which were lemony-sour, garlicky and awesome.</p>
<p>Food is simple, large and tasty, with beautiful flavours and the minimum of fuss. For starters, it was various culturally-appropriate things, which were very good: tsatsiki (nice but not outstanding), pickled calamari (not nearly as rubbery as all that but still kind of rubbery), deep fried crispy sardines (I have a deep fried fondness for deep fried sardines, they are wonderful), and a tomato, red onion and anchovy salad that was tasty but a little too simple for the price.</p>
<p>Service was friendly, casual but attentive, very good.</p>
<p>The venue is lovely and belies the name &#8211; nothing sloppy about this creatively decorated space. Lots of food paraphernalia (tins, bottles, vegetables, things) strung out all over the place, backed by warm paint tones and an open kitchen. Only complaint: we were seated in the window and the curtain of fairy lights made it hot hot hot. Bonus on window seating: the building across the road has really awesome coloured lights which we spent most of the night figuring out.</p>
<p>Overall: great place, great experience. Yay! Also, chalk up 1 to me for restraint, of alcoholic* kind, and actually driving to salty cracker for a change. Jo: 1, Stv: 37. She edges in. She&#8217;s getting there.</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8 / 10 (target: mediterranean relaxation. Mission: accomplished.)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (friendly, relaxed, attentive)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 8 / 10 (see: atmosphere)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (simple but hits the spot)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 9 / 10. (that means good, i.e. cheap :))</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: Drinking copiously at lunch and being unable to face much more alcohol may have had something to do with it.</p>

<p>Oops, been a while since the actual eatings.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.fiveflies.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fiveflies.co.za/', 'http://www.fiveflies.co.za/']);">http://www.fiveflies.co.za/</a>.<br/>
In a very cool, many-roomed, many-bar-ed (although we just went for din-dins), big ole building in the middle of town is Five Flies.<br/>
I&#8217;ve heard varying things, mostly since going there, about the snootiness of the staff. We had a great experience &#8211; our waitress was lovely, and the one or two others who flew around our table were jovial and friendly. The maitre d&#8217; looked a bit offish, but we only exchanged a word or two with him, so no probs there.</p>
<p>The food, you say?</p>
<p>Starters:<br/>
me, jess &#8211; Smoked salmon and cod fritters with rosti, watercress and garlic aioli;<br/>
jo &#8211; Pan-fried prawns with chilli, garlic linguini and squid ink lemon butter;<br/>
eck &#8211; Grilled field mushroom with gorgonzola, caramelized onion and creamy artichoke, truffle sauce.</p>
<p>Mains:<br/>
jess, jo &#8211; Springbok Wellington with mushroom duxelle, roasted butternut and foie gras, truffle jus;<br/>
me &#8211; Grilled ostrich fillet with potato gratin, mange tout, sauteed spinach and red wine sauce;<br/>
eck &#8211; Herb crusted, roasted rack of lamb with creamy garlic potatoes, fine beans and tomato jus.</p>
<p>Dessert:<br/>
I seem to remember that we did somehow squeeze it in, but I can&#8217;t remember who had what, when, why, or whicheeba.</p>
<p>The food was great. All round good with no duds.<br/>
Particular highlights were the &#8216;strich and Eck&#8217;s lamb (informally voted overall winner).</p>
<p>Odd thing to note, but not really a bad thing, was the speed.<br/>
They must have an entire team of chef whipping boys / girls because that kitchen can turn stuff around like a professional ice skater, on happy juice, going downhill, blindfold. Fast, I mean. Very fast. We didn&#8217;t feel like we were being rushed, but we were surprised when our starters arrived maybe 10 minutes after we ordered them. And the mains maybe 15 minutes after the starters were taken away.<br/>
I suppose you could argue that that&#8217;s what restaurant kitchens are supposed to be like (you order your food, you get it!), but we&#8217;re used to a more leisurely pace of noshing.<br/>
I&#8217;d quite like to pop back there for lunch to see how the experience compares.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite compote menthol (ahem) enough to do proper numbers, so have some pseudo-random ones:<br/>
<strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 6 / 10 (got a bit loud later on, with a bad table across from us)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (speedy, smiley, accommodating)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 8 / 10 (extra points for pace, especially when you known about it in advance)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (good, solid, fare, and some interesting combos)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 7 / 10. (Um&#8230; how much was it&#8230;?)</p>

<p>Woo!</p>
<p>The slightly last minute choice to do Cracker at all this month, and the choice of venue, seemed to work out well. Wasabi (<a href="http://www.wasabi.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wasabi.co.za/', 'official site']);">official site</a>, <a href="http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/3686/search/cape-town/seafood-sushi-asian/wasabi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/3686/search/cape-town/seafood-sushi-asian/wasabi', '@ eat out']);">@ eat out</a>, <a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-2535.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-2535.html', '@ dining-out']);">@ dining-out</a>) in <a href="http://www.constantiavillage.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.constantiavillage.co.za/', 'Constantia Village']);">Constantia Village</a> was great. I&#8217;m trying to keep Japanese-ish themes for my picks and not (just) sushi joints as I realise that not all the Crackers love sushi as much as I do :-). We also had a special guest star: Jess Ma!</p>
<p>We had a great waiter &#8211; Darren, IIRC &#8211; who employed Surfer Zen to deal with the a-bit-mad shenanigans of our table with dignity and aplomb. He was pleasant, attentive, and friendly without being intrusive &#8211; a difficult combo to get right. Also, he said Bru a lot, which was schweet :). We gave a healthy tip on the bill, which he richly deserved.</p>
<p>The restaurant is technically in a mall, but it&#8217;s not in the main building. There&#8217;s a satellite mini-mall thing with a few shops and a few restaurants, with much of it open to the sky (a la <a href="http://www.willowbridge.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.willowbridge.co.za/', 'Willowbridge']);">Willowbridge</a>, my favourite shopping centre that&#8217;s nothing like a shopping centre, where Jo and I often go and nosh when I&#8217;m at her offices). The place was bustling but not crowded, and it felt like we had our own space, despite the fact there were a couple of table around us.</p>
<p>For starters, we shared a bunch of Dim Sum and related type things &#8211; lamb gyoza, chicken siu mai, prawn har gau, duck spring rolls, some tempura prawns and a Thai beef salad. The actual dim sum ones were well made (and all aufentic and stuff), and were pleasant enough, but not massively tasty. The lamb gyoza were tasty, but unlike any other gyoza I&#8217;ve had before &#8211; bit dry. The duck spring rolls were great, but the winner for me was the Thai beef salad &#8211; the sweet chilli and stuff sauce was divine and the beef was just cooked enough.</p>
<p>The food was a bit slow between starters and mains, but our waiter was good with the wine refills (and the jugs of tap water), so it wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p>For main course the table had Tuna Steak (Jo (seared (the Tuna, no the Jo) and Eck), Crispy Duck (Jess), Grilled Linefish [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panga" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panga', 'panga']);">panga</a>] (Jill), Steamed Salmon (me). Jo&#8217;s Tuna came out cooked, not seared, so she sent it back. No questioning from the staff, no quibbling, just apologies and a quick turn around for the replacement choona, which was fantastic. The duck was, as expected, superb &#8211; crunchy, crispy, pancakey. The Panga was very tasty &#8211; good fish! Winner for me was my salmon (tra la la) which was soft, tasty, and had a delicious delicate sauce &#8211; salty, slightly sweet.</p>
<p>Somehow dessert was managed by some of the table. Eck had the restaurant&#8217;s signature Peppermint Zen (a big glass of layered peppermint and caramel bits), Jess had Three Lindt Ball Eruption (no sniggering at the back!), Jo had the Sorbet Threesome (no sniggering at the back!) which Jill and I kindly helped with (no sni- um &#8230;). The Zen was great, but large &#8211; Eck fought bravely, though, and made it to the end. The Balls were good &#8211; chocolatey and appropriately messy. The sorbet was very refreshing and unusually flavoured.</p>
<p>I only took a flying glance at their sushi menu as I didn&#8217;t want to be tempted, but it looks like they&#8217;ve got some interesting stuff, so Jo and I will be returning for raw fish and rice soon.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Hitting a restaurant with a definite reputation for The Trendy is always a bit of a mixed experience &#8211; one wants to find out what all the fuss is about, and is also slightly braced for it to be mostly about marketing. The Savoy Cabbage seems to carry a lot of reputation baggage, which makes it particularly ironic that the first problem with the evening was finding the damned thing. This was partly my fault &#8211; I&#8217;d looked up the address, but hadn&#8217;t found a map or anything. In the event &#8220;Hout St., near Heritage Square&#8221; turned out to be a wholly inadequate designation because the bloody restaurant is one of those coy, understated sort of establishments with a small, discreet and rather pretentious twisted wrought-iron plaque rather than an actual sign. We drove straight past it. Then we spent twenty minutes circling the centre of town in an increasingly desperate attempt to navigate the one-way system and the incredible confusion of the Greenmarket Square roadworks, which randomly close off whole roads at whim. (What are they even doing there, anyway? apart from booting the market out just in time for tourist season?). Eventually I phoned the restaurant to get directions, and I have to say the nice man was very kind and only laughed at us a little bit. We arrived eventually, triumphant and slightly giggly.</p>
<p>I rather like the inside of the Cabbage, it&#8217;s got that industrial feel &#8211; naked brickwork, giant air-con ducts, interesting spaces &#8211; which managed to stay just on the right side of pretentious. The vibe is pleasantly relaxed, and there&#8217;s a fairly continual trickle of cheerful guests climbing the stairs to the upper-level bar. I&#8217;m not entirely sure that the split-level thing works, though, the giant central staircase means that some tables are tucked away, which seems to require the waitstaff to have orienteering badges as much as the guests: we sat at our table for twenty minutes before a waiter actually worked out that we hadn&#8217;t been given a menu. (We had, however, been given a complimentary canape, and after ten minutes of wistful panting a passing waiter took pity on us and opened our wine. Memo to self, screw tops in future!).</p>
<p>The see-saw of the experience really got going with the actual arrival of our waiter, who was a gem &#8211; one of those intelligent, amusing guys who seemed perfectly happy to plug into the relaxed and slightly scurrilous vibe which Salty Cracker appears to generate. The menu is delectable, really interesting combinations of flavours, unusual vegetables, meats and cuts. There was much debate. When we finally ordered Jo asked the waiter if we&#8217;d picked anything that would disappoint us, and he gave his list a deliberately staged and cursory looking-over at arm&#8217;s length before saying &#8220;No!&#8221; firmly. We liked him. He was also thereafter very good with keeping wine glasses and water jugs filled.</p>
<p>We also liked the starters, which were, I think, on the whole better than the main courses. I&#8217;d heard good things about the Cabbage&#8217;s signature tomato tart, which was, alas, absent from the menu: the butternut/caramelised onion/goat&#8217;s milk feta one I had was, however, very good, and I shall definitely do my damndest to recreate the combination at home one of these days. Jo &amp; the Evil Landlord had the beef tartare, which I think is probably the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted &#8211; full of celery, strangely, which I don&#8217;t usually enjoy but which gave it a wonderful bite and texture. I am, however, wishing I&#8217;d ordered Steve&#8217;s starter, which was definitely the winner &#8211; chicken-liver parfait in a sort of fig sauce thing, and more like foie gras than it had any right to be. (And I have to say, I always wonder what restaurants think about the Salty Cracker tendency to pass forkfulls of a dish promiscuously around the table. And to return the plates with nothing left except fingermarks in the sauce. It&#8217;s a toss-up as to whether they&#8217;re horrified or flattered.)</p>
<p>Things got a bit dodgy with the main course. On the upside: man, they do large portions. This is the nouveau cuisine sort of presentation, but with portions almost twice the size of those at somewhere like Ginja. Steve&#8217;s Three Little Pigs thing was very good -three sorts of pork in a cider sauce, lovely stuff. Jo&#8217;s great hunk of veal had, interestingly, a bone sticking out of it, but was likewise wonderful, with an incredibly intense mushroomy sort of pâté thing on the side. The Evil Landlord&#8217;s warthog chunk was a bit smaller and slightly boringly presented, no really stand-out flavours. My breast of duck, served on a completely wonderful parsnip mash with endive, which I love &#8230; was tough. Overcooked, leathery, dry. I am totally spoiled for duck by the French tendency to sear the outside of a duck breast like steak and serve it rare, and I&#8217;d fondly hoped that this might be the same, but I suspect they slightly overcooked it in the pan and then kept it warm long enough for it to dry out even further. Jo, fortunately, is less diffident than I am about this sort of thing, and hauled the waiter over to complain: the restaurant thereafter gained serious brownie points by dealing gracefully with the issue, whisking my plate away to re-do it (a bit of a wait, inevitably, made bearable by being fed forkfuls by everyone else, like a baby bird). The second version was indeed rare, although I suspect they went slightly too much in the other direction; nonetheless it was good, if not as tender as it could have been.</p>
<p>We were too full for dessert. This almost never happens. We looked wistfully at the dessert menu, which was fabulous, but couldn&#8217;t contemplate forcing anything else down.</p>
<p>So, overall this was a very endive/cider sauce experience &#8211; bittersweet. On the upside: attractive, unusual setting and relaxed feel, lovely staff, some amazing food, the ability to handle dissatisfied patrons sending food back to the kitchen with a certain dignity, and without bad vibes resulting. On the downside: some poor staff co-ordination, slightly slow service (we waited a while for the starter) and some definitely dodgy quality control in the kitchen. Also, their prices are about 20% higher than somewhere like Overture or Ginja, and despite the increased portion size, I don&#8217;t think the flavour/innovation levels of the food quite justify it. Jo’s famous four-point scale comes out thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8</li>
<li><strong>Staff</strong>: 8 (but <strong>Service</strong> 6)</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: 7</li>
<li><strong>Value for money</strong>: 6</li>

<p>Bread and Wine, at Moreson Wine Estate near Franschhoek, do not take the N2, allow 45 minutes for driving. Minimum. But. Worth it.</p>
<p>B&amp;W has a lovely, shaded courtyard perfect for lunch. When we arrived, it was a little too shady, what with the evil clouds and all. The inside is very nice too, though, giant ostentatious chandeliers in otherwise down to earth, barn-type venue. Bonus points: Watercolours of their favourite menu items on the walls here and there (menu obviously does not change much!). (Edit: They did move us outside when the sun came out resulting in lovely summerly mains under the tree).</p>
<p>They specialise in home-made, cradle-to-the-grave-and-beyond-charcuterie (oh, that one&#8217;s not going to be picked up by any food magazines), slaughtered, cured, smoked and otherwise perfected by the chef. We shared a platter for a starter (R95), before the other starters that is. It was lovely and interesting and very munchable. Concensus was that it is entirely insufficient as a main meal though, but then we are piggies after all.</p>
<p>Backtracking, the winelist is lovely and very reasonable, since it is on a wine estate. It is their own wine, but that is not a bad thing &#8211; Chardonnay was particularly nice. 3 bottle lunch! New heights, new lows.</p>
<p>Starters &#8211; i specifically came back to this place (it was my birthday restaurant last Feb. I think.) because of the risotto, which was a little different this time (peas replaced asparagus, as far as I remember), but still divine. White, truffly risotto, mmhm. Jess&#8217;s not-gniocchi (stuffed with yummy green stuff! with yummy green sauce! oh, if any of the ingredients were actually remembered, this would be like a food review!). The menfolk had reddish things: an out of character tomoto-type salady thing Without Any Meat for the EL, and  something auberginy for Stv. Oh dear. I don&#8217;t remember any of the stuff! I was eating risotto! It was delectable! It caused temporary other food amnesia! Stv&#8217;s was better than Eckie&#8217;s, if this helps.</p>
<p>Mains &#8211; a polarisation of the table into Ladies&#8217; Pork Bellies and Men&#8217;s Gemsbok fillets. Tough one. The bellies were rolled, and very tasty, but we have been overly spoiled by the always different, always amazing, 101 ways to make heavenly things form pig&#8217;s stomachs the Overture does, and so the Gemsbok won for me. (Of course I had the marital 50% of it!). Gemsbok had some sort of berry thing going on and was simply divine.</p>
<p>After that, only room for (excellent) truffles and (much needed) coffee, followed by a walk through the winelands and to the river, in which I was successfully discouraged from swimming in. Probably a good thing in hindsight, it was a bit manky, but then what are memories made of if not random bouts of bilharzia? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, service: friendly, smiley, helpful, but frequently unwilling to acknowedge the 4-of-July parade acrobatics I had to attempt to get their attentions. I am Sitting Right Here! That&#8217;s my Limbs all in the Air! But, for leisurely lunch purposes, it was, you know, leisurely. Came to R1450 with food, wine and generous tip for 4.</p>

<p>Okay, so it wasn&#8217;t shortly, and this isn&#8217;t really a review, but it needs to be said that Cargills (<a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-50.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-50.html', 'at dining-out.co.za']);">at dining-out.co.za</a>, <a href="http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&#038;RestaurantID=2966" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&amp;RestaurantID=2966', 'at eatout.co.za']);">at eatout.co.za</a>) was fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the distant past now, so I unfortunately can&#8217;t remember much detail (that&#8217;s my advanced age for you), but the general standard of food was excellent. The waiter was attentive and friendly without being clingy (important in such a small venue) and the chef was pleasingly cheery when he came out to see how the food was going down. Slightly short, slightly round, very smiley. :)</p>
<p>I think there were mussels, Camembert, and mushrooms for starters &#8211; nummy!<br/>
Main courses were Sole with parsley lemon butter (gentle and subtle and cooked to perfection), Springbok with mixed berry jus (great red flavours to match the red meat), Confit of Duck (Jess, comments, as our resident duckspert?) Beef Fillet Bordelaise (good cow!).</p>
<p>There were five of us, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some things.<br/>
Like the stir fried veggies that are served as sides instead of the standard meh creamed spinach and fries. Very tasty.</p>
<p>Om nom nom!</p>

<p>Or,</p>
<h3>A Tale Of Two Restaurants</h3>
<p>It was the best of Crack, it was the worst of Crack.<br/>
No, wait.<br/>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a Salty Cracker.<br/>
Uh&#8230; no.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a review of <a href="http://eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&#038;RestaurantID=5599" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article-int', 'http://eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&amp;RestaurantID=5599', 'Kubo&#8217;s Little Japan']);">Kubo&#8217;s Little Japan</a> on Riebeek St in town, even though that was my choice for June Crackage.<br/>
Jo&#8217;s eagle eyes spotted it tucked away near the corner of Buitengracht and Riebeek street, and we hung a U-turn to park smartly right by the front door. It looked kind of quiet (and dark), but we ventured in anyways. Turns out Kubo&#8217;s is shut for the next few months, as the kind gentleman in the Boom Boom Shakalak bar on the floor above informed us.</p>
<p>Walking briskly back to the car, we shot off for my back up plan: <a href="http://home.intekom.com/fujiyama/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://home.intekom.com/fujiyama/', 'Fujiyama']);">Fujiyama</a> (conveniently located under <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/03/28/cedar-cafe/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/03/28/cedar-cafe/', 'Cedar Cafe']);">Cedar Cafe</a>). Also looked kind of quiet (and dark), and had a &#8220;To Let&#8221; sign in the window. Twas not boding well.<br/>
However, they were open &#8211; huzzah! And tasty &#8211; hazzuh!<br/>
We were the only people in the front room all night, which was kind of strange, but kind of entertaining too. Noticed right at the end of the night that there were three other rooms there, including a traditional shoes-off, low-down-table one. Squee!</p>
<p>We got a little bowl of some marinated nummy, soy saucey, slighty sweety tuna for an appetiser, then dove into a table-shared two big plates of veggie and fishy tempura and a plate of chicken katsu. Nom!<br/>
The chicken was good, but the tempura was ace. Very light and crispy.</p>
<p>Main course action was: beef soba (soup w/ thin noodles) for Jo; beef udon (soup w/ fat noodles) for me; chicken nabe (brothy soup w/ noodles) for Jess; fillet teppanyaki for Eckhard.<br/>
My soup was very, very, tasty and had a nice, thinly sliced, chunk of meat and a few crunchy veggies in.<br/>
Eck&#8217;s fillet cubes were medium-rared to perfection.</p>
<p>The wine list was also reasonably priced. It is, of course, marked up from farm price, but not by a nosebleed-inducing amount (unlike someplaces *cough* myoga *cough*. Well, to be fair, <em>most</em> restaurants.).</p>
<p>The bad news is they&#8217;re closing, sort of, in the next few days. Actually, they&#8217;re moving to two spots on Long Street. One on Long, opposite the Purple Turtle, for take-aways, and one around the corner for sit-downs (the head waiter gentlemen kindly informed us on our way out).</p>
<p>All in all, a successful Crackage, despite the initial impending doom feeling when 1st choice was closed.<br/>
I look forward to trying their new place. Japanese food FTW!</p>
