		<description><![CDATA[I could go for skank ;&gt;. Benkei looks as though it might fit into that mould. I&#039;m also up for something with Enormous Plates Of Food, as opposed to Restrained Taste Sensations. Possibly it&#039;s the weather. 

This would all be a lot more useful if I thought my Evil Landlord was reading it, since it&#039;s his choice next...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the nouvelle ones are definitely a &quot;later&quot; bunch.

Actually, I&#039;m kind of keen to do something a bit skanky, but with a dash of charm and fookin&#039; ace food.
Like Jewel Tavern. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dammit, now I&#039;ve spent the last hour reading menus and am consequently &lt;i&gt;starved&lt;/i&gt;. 

Myoga, not for a while. Too similar to Ginja, which is not a bad thing, only not immediately. Definitely Comida in summer, they do duck :&gt;. Touch of Madness fails the apostrophe test. Salt, Aubergine and 95 Keerom look great, but may be a bit too nouvelle too soon. I&#039;d be keen to try Benkei, I liked their menu. Or the other Japanese places, actually. 

Damn, I may need to go and get a chocolate bar.]]></description>
