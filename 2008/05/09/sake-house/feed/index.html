		<description><![CDATA[Most people like to champion the more expensive Willoughby&#039;s at the waterfront as the best sushi in CT, but Sake House is definitely in my top 5 of joints that do tasty and not too expensive sushi.

Sake House has great sushi, nummy sashimi and a nice range of weird / nouveau / fusion sushi.
I particularly dig the Africa Dream (with springbok carpaccio - mmm...).

The decor is groovy - all dark wood and light colour bamboo type things. Only downside is the telly over the bar which can be distracting.]]></description>
