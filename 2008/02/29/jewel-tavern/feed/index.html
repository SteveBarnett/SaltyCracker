The new location is very nice.
I miss the unique charm of the docks location, but only a little bit.
The food is still the best Chinese cuisine in Cape Town!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I say one thing: crispy duck with pancakes. I could eat several platesful of their crispy duck with pancakes all on my own, and may in fact have to do so sometime soon, just because. 

I love the disconnect between the ambience (docks dive) and the food (high quality).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I really like about the JT is that it&#039;s authentic. I mean that the food tastes like Chinese food for Chinese people, not like Chinese food for the white man.

Don&#039;t get me Wong [sic]: tastiness is the priority.
But, if you can have it tasty &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; authentic, why not?

The location is also fab: deep in the docks, near(ish) Panama Jack&#039;s. Skanky tables covered in plastic, old Lazy Susan&#039;s for the spinning. Chinese Seamen everywhere. You get the idea.
Awesome.]]></description>
