		<description><![CDATA[I love the Hussar, it&#039;s like dining out at home. My only minor niggles were the slowness of service (which is always a problem, actually - I thought poor, starving Jo was going to start taking bites from the next door table at one point) and the starter, which was a bit stringy. I&#039;ve definitely had better deep-fried camembert from Hussar, they must have been having an off evening. But the warthog ribs were, as always, excellent, and I am deeply happy that they&#039;ve started serving mash with the grills.]]></description>
