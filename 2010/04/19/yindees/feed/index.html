		<description><![CDATA[We ate in Yindees a few months ago and to be honest it didnt really rock my world.  The food was okish, but no atmosphere, (we were there for Sunday lunch) and the room was very cold (it was winter, but...).  Since then I have eaten in Soho beside Jacks Pub, behind the new Cape Quarter - the first time it was excellent, the second time, not quite as good, but nonetheless i would recommend any Thai afficiandos to give it a try.  The nice thing there is that you can take the menu to the top outside deck and have your meal beside the lap pool with an uninterrupted view of the mountain, pretty amazing.]]></description>
