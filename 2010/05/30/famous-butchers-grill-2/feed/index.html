		<description><![CDATA[I see no reason why a reviewer shouldn&#039;t be allowed to change their mind, especially so soon after the event.
Perhaps &lt; del &gt; the old score and put the new one?

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; bloom of meaty health
Quite a mental image...

Hmm, in general: word, sister!
It was a bit disappointing.

Luckily the mariachi&#039;s sets were quite short. There was something about the quality / type of sound that made it a bit more distracting than background music.

I&#039;m noticing a trend in CT service - the waitbots are attentive and friendly until you get the starters. Then they downgrade you a priority level. Then, when you get your main course, you go down another priority level. I&#039;d like to see high priority throughout the meal.
If you ever have to search for a waiter, rather than just wave / hail / semaphore from your table, then - waiternating, ur doing it wrong.

The place was very pretty, but I found the seats a bit uncomfortable, and I felt a bit squished. Very warm-feeling, though.


Here endeth the whinge.]]></description>
