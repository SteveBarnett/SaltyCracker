		<description><![CDATA[Agreed!
The combination of high-end service with the smiles and warmth and accommodatingness (ahem) make for a spectacular experience.

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll going back there any time soon, but only because the price is at the high end of high for me. I didn&#039;t feel at all cheated or that I wasn&#039;t getting value for money. It&#039;s just that is is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of money!

Note to self: must go back to Overture soon.
Oh, wait, we have a table booked for when Lucky is here.
