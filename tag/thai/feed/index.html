				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was, of course, tempted to write this review in Haiku format.<br />
But I did not.<br />
Be thankful.</p>
<p><a href="http://bukhara.com/haiku/">Haiku</a> was great. I&#8217;ve had my Japanese-Cracker hand forced slightly due to lack of availability (if you know a good Japanese restaurant in Cape Town, please drop it in the comments!), so I&#8217;ve expanded my general theme to <em>Asian, preferably Japanese (because i like it), preferably not Thai (because we eat it at home a lot).</em></p>
<p>The place itself is tres chic. The bar at the front is particularly swish. We&#8217;re talking dark furnishings, a few shiny bits, and lots of spotlights (hung from the tall, tall, ceiling to head high (ish)). It felt a little too trendy for me, to be honest, but the staff were welcoming and friendly (and I&#8217;m not exactly Mr TrendyPants (as evidenced by me saying Mr TrendyPants)). The back 4/5 of the place is the restaurant, with a strip all the way down one side being the kitchen and the gaggle (pot? susan? broth?) of chefs, all specialists in their various bits.</p>
<p>The menu is <strong>big</strong> (and missing from their web site &#8211; boo). Three pages big, packed with tasty-sounding treats. It&#8217;s divided into sections by style more than by country, so you have stir-fried dishes together, tempura stuff together, and so on.<br />
Roughly speaking, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li>veggie tempura (solid, but not amazing. Great sauce, though);</li>
<li>soft shell crab tempura (very good. Crunchy!);</li>
<li>Chicken and mushroom hotpot (a surprise star. Recommended by the waiter on the grounds of being a lot more interesting than it sounds. He was right!);</li>
<li>Dim Sum (<strong>lots</strong> of dim sum. I think I may have found a place to return to regularly for Dim Sum &#8211; is good, me like.);</li>
<li>Cheung Fun (chinese canneloni, which I remember first having as chopstick-test by Chinese friends in London.);</li>
<li>duck pancakes (of course. Hat tip JT. Good, but not amazing);</li>
<li>Beef katsu (breadcrumbed, seared, cow.);</li>
<li>Thai salad (the weakest dish of the lot. A bit too fusion, so it lost it Thai character);</li>
<li>Sizzling ostrich (juicy and tasty, but not mind-blowing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! And I&#8217;m sure I missed some. We definitely over-ordered. But then, it was Salty Cracker. :)</p>
<p>Service was good, but very slightly patchy. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, except for a short period near the end-game when I was wanting water and to ask for the bill.</p>
<p>Ratings? Ratings.</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 7 / 10 (Very trendy, but still nice for &#8220;normal&#8221; folk. Ahem.)<br />
<strong>Staff</strong>: 9 / 10 (Friendly, chatty, excellent knowledge of the menu, very good with recommendations.)<br />
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (No real complaints, but wouldn&#8217;t mention it as special.)<br />
<strong>Food</strong>: 8 / 10 (A wide spread of countries and styles without feeling stretched or that there are any &#8220;filler&#8221; items (iyswim), and very, very, tasty.)<br />
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 6 / 10 (Pricey for what is, especially the Dim Sum.)</p>
<hr /><strong>Addendum:</strong> We jetted off to <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/02/29/jewel-tavern/">the Jewel Tavern</a> last night for a quick Chinese comparison. It&#8217;s a tough call, to be honest. Jewel has a lot more of the classics, and it does them very well, at a good price. Haiku&#8217;s Chinese section contains more unusual stuff, but at a higher price point.</p>
