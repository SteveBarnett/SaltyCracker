		<description><![CDATA[It was all good, man.
All the food was great, the wine (and portion sizes thereof :] ) were great, the service was great.
Definitely a contender for #1 Salty Cracker Experience. Overture and Ginja - celebrity deathmatch!

My little fishy on a dishy was probably my favourite of the lot, but the duck with *that* Merlot also rocked mightily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tilapia. The little Malawian fish are called Tilapia. I&#039;m wishing I&#039;d ordered that as well. The duck was crispy duck, but incredibly moist inside the skin; it came with potatoes and veggies which I also can&#039;t remember.

My only negative for the evening is that my misbehaving belly precluded me having the pork belly, which was awesome. And the Merlot was beautiful. I don&#039;t even like Merlot particularly, but I want more of that one. 

I enjoyed driving home! your car, she is friendly.]]></description>
