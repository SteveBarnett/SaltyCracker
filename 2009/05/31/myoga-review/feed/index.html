Concur re look. Actually, it reminded me a bit of Pigalle in terms of big, shiny, rich feeling. But without the trashy after taste that the &#039;galle has. Myoga was elegant and posh.

One thing I really liked was the friendliness of the staff. The crowd were clearly the Rich Bitch TM end of Cape Town diners, but the staff were still down to earth. Even the sommy man, despite the pretentious (part of the job) wine talk. Unlike the purple veggie restaurant of shame, I never felt out of place (despite my straw vest and feather boa combo).

The food was really great, as was the price, but I totally agree re wine. I didn&#039;t quite feel like I&#039;d been conned, but I do feel that I don&#039;t like paying that much for wine. I&#039;d rather spend money on more food!
It seems that either telling the sommelier we won&#039;t be needing his services, or that we want to see the list,  will be future courses of action.
Although it&#039;s unusual for us not to take our own wine...

Ooh, it&#039;s me next, ennit?
I&#039;d better go dig up some ideas...]]></description>
