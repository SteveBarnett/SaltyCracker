		<description><![CDATA[I believe me and Jo shared a Vietnamese spring roll basket-thing and a Tom Yum spicy soup. The rolls were great, and the soup, although not that authentic, was very good. Nice level of bite.

The meaty choco chilli thing was ace, as was the shank. No-one&#039;s ever really matched Zingara&#039;s choc chilli steak for me, but the Figgers came close.

I did get a bit worried at the start of the meal. It took them a good ten minutes to come and serve us once we were seated. I was thirsty!]]></description>
