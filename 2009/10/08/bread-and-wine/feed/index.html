&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moreson.co.za/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moreson wine estate&lt;/a&gt;; menu details at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lqf.co.za/cuisine/bread-and-wine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LQF&lt;/a&gt;.

My red starter thing was braised Italian plum tomatoes, aubergine ravioli and tapenade, and was Teh Nom. The meat platter was fantastic, but the risotto was the winningest starter for me. Superb, subtle flavours.

The piggy belly was very good, but the Gemsbok was divine. With butternut spatzle and morel jus, according to the linky above. I think Eck commented that it didn&#039;t taste strongly of Gemsbok (just meaty. not that that&#039;s a bad thing), and I agree, but that could&#039;ve just been the char-grilly flavour (which was gooood).]]></description>
