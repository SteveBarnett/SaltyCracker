		<description><![CDATA[I really like Cargills - it does the classic French cuisine thing on a slightly intense and idiosyncratic small scale, with huge and wayward tailoring to the whims of the cook. It&#039;s such a cosy space, and I very much enjoy the personal feeling and the small number of staff. I think the cook&#039;s alone in that kitchen; the time I ate there with Anthony, the cook was also serving tables, and with considerable aplomb flung together a vegetarian option from ingredients at hand since the menu didn&#039;t have much for the non-carnivore.

I love their almond-laced stir-fry, and have a complete and unrepentant adoration for the mashed-potato-and-herb rissoles which come standard with most of the meals. At this distance I honestly can&#039;t remember what the duck was like - I think good, without being spectacular, but very orangey. I like that in a duck. The berry jus on the springbok was delectable.]]></description>
