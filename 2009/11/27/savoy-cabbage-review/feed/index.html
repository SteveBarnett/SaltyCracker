		<description><![CDATA[I also dug the deco. There was a fan above the table that I kept catching the shadow of on the table. Added a noir-ness.
There was also quite a nice mix of clientelle, mostly on the posh side, but I didn&#039;t get a wiff of any snootification happening, so that was cool. The owner lady and maitre d&#039; dude 
 were both lovely.
I did get a bit worried when we sat down and weren&#039;t attended to for a little while...

I completely agree that the starters were better than the mains.
My parfait was Best In Show for me. As is my Parfait. :)
All the mains were good without being great, but the generous portions were a welcome surprise.

Almost lost my eyes through popping out when I glanced at the wine list while we were waiting for the bill, though. The majority were around the 200 mark, with plenty of bottles above that - eep! Good thing we&#039;re bring-a-bottle types. :)

I still want my orienteering Scouts/Guides-style badge, btw.
Perhaps tattoos instead?

Ideas for other badges: person who calls for water - JugHead badge; person who gets rid of sommelier - &lt;a href=&quot;http://saltycracker.co.za/2008/10/31/aubergine-review/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Little Fishes&lt;/a&gt; badge; person who spots air-con pipes - Nakatomi badge.]]></description>
