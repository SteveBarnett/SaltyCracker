		<description><![CDATA[The place gave me the weirdest sense of &lt;i&gt;surface&lt;/i&gt; - as though it was going through the motions of high-end nouvelle cuisine in its presentation and concept, but the food itself was a bit hollow. You can&#039;t say that squiggles of sauce make for fine dining if the sauce in question is indifferent mayonnaise, and it doesn&#039;t matter how fancy your menu is if every second dish is served with the same dollop of kimchi. The whole experience feels as though it&#039;s pretending to be something it isn&#039;t really. Which is a pity, because overall the food is actually quite good, and it was rather an enjoyable evening.]]></description>
