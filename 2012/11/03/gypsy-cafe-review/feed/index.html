		<description><![CDATA[We have been to Gypsy Cafe once and found it very nice. We went on a weeknight at 6, just as they opened, and about a month after they opened up shop. The food was very nice, if a little pricey for Obs. I did feel a bit odd when I asked if the chicken was free range and the dude was all &quot;blah blah cost, business decision&quot; etc. I wanted to say &quot;you&#039;re obviously going more upmarket than other Obs restaurants and price as such, surely you can afford FR chicken (which isn&#039;t actually that much more expensive)&quot;. Anyway, we&#039;d go back sometime if we remembered to. 

You guys should totally try Lion Corner, it&#039;s faaaaaaaaaabulous :)]]></description>
