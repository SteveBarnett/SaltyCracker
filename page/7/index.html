<p>I wanted a comfy, homey, snuggly vibe, with no sign of pretentiousness and giant portions. Check. Sloppy Sam&#8217;s is all those things, delivered with a mediterranean flair and plenty of lamb. Lamb, lamb, wonderful lamb, rolled with garlic on kebab sticks (Jess and Stv), slowly braised into melting goodness (EL), its ribs crisped with garlic and lemon (next time, next time) or in an iraqui abgusht stew with dried limes (yet another visit needed).  Defiantly, I had calamari, which were lemony-sour, garlicky and awesome.</p>
<p>Food is simple, large and tasty, with beautiful flavours and the minimum of fuss. For starters, it was various culturally-appropriate things, which were very good: tsatsiki (nice but not outstanding), pickled calamari (not nearly as rubbery as all that but still kind of rubbery), deep fried crispy sardines (I have a deep fried fondness for deep fried sardines, they are wonderful), and a tomato, red onion and anchovy salad that was tasty but a little too simple for the price.</p>
<p>Service was friendly, casual but attentive, very good.</p>
<p>The venue is lovely and belies the name &#8211; nothing sloppy about this creatively decorated space. Lots of food paraphernalia (tins, bottles, vegetables, things) strung out all over the place, backed by warm paint tones and an open kitchen. Only complaint: we were seated in the window and the curtain of fairy lights made it hot hot hot. Bonus on window seating: the building across the road has really awesome coloured lights which we spent most of the night figuring out.</p>
<p>Overall: great place, great experience. Yay! Also, chalk up 1 to me for restraint, of alcoholic* kind, and actually driving to salty cracker for a change. Jo: 1, Stv: 37. She edges in. She&#8217;s getting there.</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8 / 10 (target: mediterranean relaxation. Mission: accomplished.)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (friendly, relaxed, attentive)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 8 / 10 (see: atmosphere)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (simple but hits the spot)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 9 / 10. (that means good, i.e. cheap :))</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: Drinking copiously at lunch and being unable to face much more alcohol may have had something to do with it.</p>

<p>Oops, been a while since the actual eatings.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.fiveflies.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fiveflies.co.za/', 'http://www.fiveflies.co.za/']);">http://www.fiveflies.co.za/</a>.<br/>
In a very cool, many-roomed, many-bar-ed (although we just went for din-dins), big ole building in the middle of town is Five Flies.<br/>
I&#8217;ve heard varying things, mostly since going there, about the snootiness of the staff. We had a great experience &#8211; our waitress was lovely, and the one or two others who flew around our table were jovial and friendly. The maitre d&#8217; looked a bit offish, but we only exchanged a word or two with him, so no probs there.</p>
<p>The food, you say?</p>
<p>Starters:<br/>
me, jess &#8211; Smoked salmon and cod fritters with rosti, watercress and garlic aioli;<br/>
jo &#8211; Pan-fried prawns with chilli, garlic linguini and squid ink lemon butter;<br/>
eck &#8211; Grilled field mushroom with gorgonzola, caramelized onion and creamy artichoke, truffle sauce.</p>
<p>Mains:<br/>
jess, jo &#8211; Springbok Wellington with mushroom duxelle, roasted butternut and foie gras, truffle jus;<br/>
me &#8211; Grilled ostrich fillet with potato gratin, mange tout, sauteed spinach and red wine sauce;<br/>
eck &#8211; Herb crusted, roasted rack of lamb with creamy garlic potatoes, fine beans and tomato jus.</p>
<p>Dessert:<br/>
I seem to remember that we did somehow squeeze it in, but I can&#8217;t remember who had what, when, why, or whicheeba.</p>
<p>The food was great. All round good with no duds.<br/>
Particular highlights were the &#8216;strich and Eck&#8217;s lamb (informally voted overall winner).</p>
<p>Odd thing to note, but not really a bad thing, was the speed.<br/>
They must have an entire team of chef whipping boys / girls because that kitchen can turn stuff around like a professional ice skater, on happy juice, going downhill, blindfold. Fast, I mean. Very fast. We didn&#8217;t feel like we were being rushed, but we were surprised when our starters arrived maybe 10 minutes after we ordered them. And the mains maybe 15 minutes after the starters were taken away.<br/>
I suppose you could argue that that&#8217;s what restaurant kitchens are supposed to be like (you order your food, you get it!), but we&#8217;re used to a more leisurely pace of noshing.<br/>
I&#8217;d quite like to pop back there for lunch to see how the experience compares.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite compote menthol (ahem) enough to do proper numbers, so have some pseudo-random ones:<br/>
<strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 6 / 10 (got a bit loud later on, with a bad table across from us)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (speedy, smiley, accommodating)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 8 / 10 (extra points for pace, especially when you known about it in advance)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (good, solid, fare, and some interesting combos)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 7 / 10. (Um&#8230; how much was it&#8230;?)</p>

<p>Woo!</p>
<p>The slightly last minute choice to do Cracker at all this month, and the choice of venue, seemed to work out well. Wasabi (<a href="http://www.wasabi.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wasabi.co.za/', 'official site']);">official site</a>, <a href="http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/3686/search/cape-town/seafood-sushi-asian/wasabi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/3686/search/cape-town/seafood-sushi-asian/wasabi', '@ eat out']);">@ eat out</a>, <a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-2535.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-2535.html', '@ dining-out']);">@ dining-out</a>) in <a href="http://www.constantiavillage.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.constantiavillage.co.za/', 'Constantia Village']);">Constantia Village</a> was great. I&#8217;m trying to keep Japanese-ish themes for my picks and not (just) sushi joints as I realise that not all the Crackers love sushi as much as I do :-). We also had a special guest star: Jess Ma!</p>
<p>We had a great waiter &#8211; Darren, IIRC &#8211; who employed Surfer Zen to deal with the a-bit-mad shenanigans of our table with dignity and aplomb. He was pleasant, attentive, and friendly without being intrusive &#8211; a difficult combo to get right. Also, he said Bru a lot, which was schweet :). We gave a healthy tip on the bill, which he richly deserved.</p>
<p>The restaurant is technically in a mall, but it&#8217;s not in the main building. There&#8217;s a satellite mini-mall thing with a few shops and a few restaurants, with much of it open to the sky (a la <a href="http://www.willowbridge.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.willowbridge.co.za/', 'Willowbridge']);">Willowbridge</a>, my favourite shopping centre that&#8217;s nothing like a shopping centre, where Jo and I often go and nosh when I&#8217;m at her offices). The place was bustling but not crowded, and it felt like we had our own space, despite the fact there were a couple of table around us.</p>
<p>For starters, we shared a bunch of Dim Sum and related type things &#8211; lamb gyoza, chicken siu mai, prawn har gau, duck spring rolls, some tempura prawns and a Thai beef salad. The actual dim sum ones were well made (and all aufentic and stuff), and were pleasant enough, but not massively tasty. The lamb gyoza were tasty, but unlike any other gyoza I&#8217;ve had before &#8211; bit dry. The duck spring rolls were great, but the winner for me was the Thai beef salad &#8211; the sweet chilli and stuff sauce was divine and the beef was just cooked enough.</p>
<p>The food was a bit slow between starters and mains, but our waiter was good with the wine refills (and the jugs of tap water), so it wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p>For main course the table had Tuna Steak (Jo (seared (the Tuna, no the Jo) and Eck), Crispy Duck (Jess), Grilled Linefish [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panga" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panga', 'panga']);">panga</a>] (Jill), Steamed Salmon (me). Jo&#8217;s Tuna came out cooked, not seared, so she sent it back. No questioning from the staff, no quibbling, just apologies and a quick turn around for the replacement choona, which was fantastic. The duck was, as expected, superb &#8211; crunchy, crispy, pancakey. The Panga was very tasty &#8211; good fish! Winner for me was my salmon (tra la la) which was soft, tasty, and had a delicious delicate sauce &#8211; salty, slightly sweet.</p>
<p>Somehow dessert was managed by some of the table. Eck had the restaurant&#8217;s signature Peppermint Zen (a big glass of layered peppermint and caramel bits), Jess had Three Lindt Ball Eruption (no sniggering at the back!), Jo had the Sorbet Threesome (no sniggering at the back!) which Jill and I kindly helped with (no sni- um &#8230;). The Zen was great, but large &#8211; Eck fought bravely, though, and made it to the end. The Balls were good &#8211; chocolatey and appropriately messy. The sorbet was very refreshing and unusually flavoured.</p>
<p>I only took a flying glance at their sushi menu as I didn&#8217;t want to be tempted, but it looks like they&#8217;ve got some interesting stuff, so Jo and I will be returning for raw fish and rice soon.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Hitting a restaurant with a definite reputation for The Trendy is always a bit of a mixed experience &#8211; one wants to find out what all the fuss is about, and is also slightly braced for it to be mostly about marketing. The Savoy Cabbage seems to carry a lot of reputation baggage, which makes it particularly ironic that the first problem with the evening was finding the damned thing. This was partly my fault &#8211; I&#8217;d looked up the address, but hadn&#8217;t found a map or anything. In the event &#8220;Hout St., near Heritage Square&#8221; turned out to be a wholly inadequate designation because the bloody restaurant is one of those coy, understated sort of establishments with a small, discreet and rather pretentious twisted wrought-iron plaque rather than an actual sign. We drove straight past it. Then we spent twenty minutes circling the centre of town in an increasingly desperate attempt to navigate the one-way system and the incredible confusion of the Greenmarket Square roadworks, which randomly close off whole roads at whim. (What are they even doing there, anyway? apart from booting the market out just in time for tourist season?). Eventually I phoned the restaurant to get directions, and I have to say the nice man was very kind and only laughed at us a little bit. We arrived eventually, triumphant and slightly giggly.</p>
<p>I rather like the inside of the Cabbage, it&#8217;s got that industrial feel &#8211; naked brickwork, giant air-con ducts, interesting spaces &#8211; which managed to stay just on the right side of pretentious. The vibe is pleasantly relaxed, and there&#8217;s a fairly continual trickle of cheerful guests climbing the stairs to the upper-level bar. I&#8217;m not entirely sure that the split-level thing works, though, the giant central staircase means that some tables are tucked away, which seems to require the waitstaff to have orienteering badges as much as the guests: we sat at our table for twenty minutes before a waiter actually worked out that we hadn&#8217;t been given a menu. (We had, however, been given a complimentary canape, and after ten minutes of wistful panting a passing waiter took pity on us and opened our wine. Memo to self, screw tops in future!).</p>
<p>The see-saw of the experience really got going with the actual arrival of our waiter, who was a gem &#8211; one of those intelligent, amusing guys who seemed perfectly happy to plug into the relaxed and slightly scurrilous vibe which Salty Cracker appears to generate. The menu is delectable, really interesting combinations of flavours, unusual vegetables, meats and cuts. There was much debate. When we finally ordered Jo asked the waiter if we&#8217;d picked anything that would disappoint us, and he gave his list a deliberately staged and cursory looking-over at arm&#8217;s length before saying &#8220;No!&#8221; firmly. We liked him. He was also thereafter very good with keeping wine glasses and water jugs filled.</p>
<p>We also liked the starters, which were, I think, on the whole better than the main courses. I&#8217;d heard good things about the Cabbage&#8217;s signature tomato tart, which was, alas, absent from the menu: the butternut/caramelised onion/goat&#8217;s milk feta one I had was, however, very good, and I shall definitely do my damndest to recreate the combination at home one of these days. Jo &amp; the Evil Landlord had the beef tartare, which I think is probably the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted &#8211; full of celery, strangely, which I don&#8217;t usually enjoy but which gave it a wonderful bite and texture. I am, however, wishing I&#8217;d ordered Steve&#8217;s starter, which was definitely the winner &#8211; chicken-liver parfait in a sort of fig sauce thing, and more like foie gras than it had any right to be. (And I have to say, I always wonder what restaurants think about the Salty Cracker tendency to pass forkfulls of a dish promiscuously around the table. And to return the plates with nothing left except fingermarks in the sauce. It&#8217;s a toss-up as to whether they&#8217;re horrified or flattered.)</p>
<p>Things got a bit dodgy with the main course. On the upside: man, they do large portions. This is the nouveau cuisine sort of presentation, but with portions almost twice the size of those at somewhere like Ginja. Steve&#8217;s Three Little Pigs thing was very good -three sorts of pork in a cider sauce, lovely stuff. Jo&#8217;s great hunk of veal had, interestingly, a bone sticking out of it, but was likewise wonderful, with an incredibly intense mushroomy sort of pâté thing on the side. The Evil Landlord&#8217;s warthog chunk was a bit smaller and slightly boringly presented, no really stand-out flavours. My breast of duck, served on a completely wonderful parsnip mash with endive, which I love &#8230; was tough. Overcooked, leathery, dry. I am totally spoiled for duck by the French tendency to sear the outside of a duck breast like steak and serve it rare, and I&#8217;d fondly hoped that this might be the same, but I suspect they slightly overcooked it in the pan and then kept it warm long enough for it to dry out even further. Jo, fortunately, is less diffident than I am about this sort of thing, and hauled the waiter over to complain: the restaurant thereafter gained serious brownie points by dealing gracefully with the issue, whisking my plate away to re-do it (a bit of a wait, inevitably, made bearable by being fed forkfuls by everyone else, like a baby bird). The second version was indeed rare, although I suspect they went slightly too much in the other direction; nonetheless it was good, if not as tender as it could have been.</p>
<p>We were too full for dessert. This almost never happens. We looked wistfully at the dessert menu, which was fabulous, but couldn&#8217;t contemplate forcing anything else down.</p>
<p>So, overall this was a very endive/cider sauce experience &#8211; bittersweet. On the upside: attractive, unusual setting and relaxed feel, lovely staff, some amazing food, the ability to handle dissatisfied patrons sending food back to the kitchen with a certain dignity, and without bad vibes resulting. On the downside: some poor staff co-ordination, slightly slow service (we waited a while for the starter) and some definitely dodgy quality control in the kitchen. Also, their prices are about 20% higher than somewhere like Overture or Ginja, and despite the increased portion size, I don&#8217;t think the flavour/innovation levels of the food quite justify it. Jo’s famous four-point scale comes out thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8</li>
<li><strong>Staff</strong>: 8 (but <strong>Service</strong> 6)</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: 7</li>
<li><strong>Value for money</strong>: 6</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Bread and Wine, at Moreson Wine Estate near Franschhoek, do not take the N2, allow 45 minutes for driving. Minimum. But. Worth it.</p>
<p>B&amp;W has a lovely, shaded courtyard perfect for lunch. When we arrived, it was a little too shady, what with the evil clouds and all. The inside is very nice too, though, giant ostentatious chandeliers in otherwise down to earth, barn-type venue. Bonus points: Watercolours of their favourite menu items on the walls here and there (menu obviously does not change much!). (Edit: They did move us outside when the sun came out resulting in lovely summerly mains under the tree).</p>
<p>They specialise in home-made, cradle-to-the-grave-and-beyond-charcuterie (oh, that one&#8217;s not going to be picked up by any food magazines), slaughtered, cured, smoked and otherwise perfected by the chef. We shared a platter for a starter (R95), before the other starters that is. It was lovely and interesting and very munchable. Concensus was that it is entirely insufficient as a main meal though, but then we are piggies after all.</p>
<p>Backtracking, the winelist is lovely and very reasonable, since it is on a wine estate. It is their own wine, but that is not a bad thing &#8211; Chardonnay was particularly nice. 3 bottle lunch! New heights, new lows.</p>
<p>Starters &#8211; i specifically came back to this place (it was my birthday restaurant last Feb. I think.) because of the risotto, which was a little different this time (peas replaced asparagus, as far as I remember), but still divine. White, truffly risotto, mmhm. Jess&#8217;s not-gniocchi (stuffed with yummy green stuff! with yummy green sauce! oh, if any of the ingredients were actually remembered, this would be like a food review!). The menfolk had reddish things: an out of character tomoto-type salady thing Without Any Meat for the EL, and  something auberginy for Stv. Oh dear. I don&#8217;t remember any of the stuff! I was eating risotto! It was delectable! It caused temporary other food amnesia! Stv&#8217;s was better than Eckie&#8217;s, if this helps.</p>
<p>Mains &#8211; a polarisation of the table into Ladies&#8217; Pork Bellies and Men&#8217;s Gemsbok fillets. Tough one. The bellies were rolled, and very tasty, but we have been overly spoiled by the always different, always amazing, 101 ways to make heavenly things form pig&#8217;s stomachs the Overture does, and so the Gemsbok won for me. (Of course I had the marital 50% of it!). Gemsbok had some sort of berry thing going on and was simply divine.</p>
<p>After that, only room for (excellent) truffles and (much needed) coffee, followed by a walk through the winelands and to the river, in which I was successfully discouraged from swimming in. Probably a good thing in hindsight, it was a bit manky, but then what are memories made of if not random bouts of bilharzia? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, service: friendly, smiley, helpful, but frequently unwilling to acknowedge the 4-of-July parade acrobatics I had to attempt to get their attentions. I am Sitting Right Here! That&#8217;s my Limbs all in the Air! But, for leisurely lunch purposes, it was, you know, leisurely. Came to R1450 with food, wine and generous tip for 4.</p>
