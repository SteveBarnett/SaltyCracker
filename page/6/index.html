<div class="entry-content">
<p>Various inflictions and deflections, like illness and overseas trips, have delayed August&#8217;s Salty Cracker expedition, which consequently took place on Friday night. I chose Bizerca, lured by the online reviews which praised its warmth, unpretentiousness and good food as well as by the magical combinations of &#8220;French&#8221;, &#8220;fusion&#8221; and &#8220;bistro&#8221;, and wow was it worth the wait. We really like this place. We had a lovely evening, and there was an indecorous level of &#8220;oohing&#8221; and &#8220;aahing&#8221; over the food.</p>
<p>I have to say, at first glance it doesn&#8217;t look promising; the plastic chairs, glass walls, art deco plastic tables and eye-watering monochrome swirls over the bar all scream &#8220;trendoid!&#8221;, which in our experience is not often synonomous with good food. However, the potentially plastic ambience is warmed and redeemed by the service , which is headed by the lovely, chatty, arm-patty wife of the cook, and by the little touches &#8211; the menu being carried around on giant chalkboards, the fact that they have a cupboard for your coats. The printed menu is tiny, the daily-changing chalkboard one huge, which strikes me as the right balance for seasonal and inventive freshness; the dishes have a high proportion of interesting ingredients and combinations, not your standard nouvelle/fusion stuff. One of those menus where it&#8217;s really difficult to choose, and as soon as you&#8217;ve ordered you immediately wish you&#8217;d ordered something else, because it all looks so good.</p>
<p>We really liked the owner-lady: she explained the specials to us, laughed at the usual Salty Cracker silliness, and was very amenable to the idea that we might suddenly decide to order the special apple tart, which needs a 45-minute lead time, by semaphore. We spent the rest of the evening carefully not raising our hands above shoulder level, just in case dessert arrived as seventeen accidental apple pies we&#8217;d then have to eat. The waiters passed the Water Test quite adequately &#8211; a slightly raised eyebrow when we eschewed bottled water, but large glasses of tap water were provided as requested, and topped up if requested. (The table was a bit small for a jug, precluding our usual technique of the Large Jug). Our wine glasses were promptly filled. And their bread is simply wonderful &#8211; hot, crusty, brown, a light, dense crumb &#8211; perfect.</p>
<p>The &#8220;wow&#8221; started with the starters. I had a venison pâté/duck rilette combo, which was good, solid flavours, nicely prepared, but was raised to sublime levels with a sort of spicy relish thing, with I think cumin seeds in it &#8211; perfectly complementary flavours. (I&#8217;m kicking myself that I didn&#8217;t have a look at their home-made jams). Jo had a seared salami starter with peas, which is quite unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen on a French fusion menu, and was wonderful and slightly startling. Stv&#8217;s raw fish whatever-it-was came as a mould, and was exquisitely flavoured, possibly the winner of the starter courses (what was it, stvil? I can&#8217;t remember). Eckhard had the pork belly starter, which was simply evil. In a good way. The starter course was accompanied by a lot of &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aah&#8221; and swapping of forks &#8211; the latter is a standard Salty Cracker practice, to the joy and/or despair of the restaurants, but the enthusiasm was damned well earned.</p>
<p>The starters arrived  very promptly, the mains less so, which was probably our fault for making noises about not wanting the evening to be over too quickly. (Nice owner lady: &#8220;You can stay here until 3am as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I&#8217;ve told the staff to delay your mains a bit.&#8221;) Jo and Eckie both had bouillabaise, which looked amazing &#8211; a rich creamy sauce rather than the usual clear soup, but intensely flavoured, served with croutons and a garlic aioli. Stv had something game-steaky? (memory goes&#8230;) It was excellent, although I can&#8217;t remember the trimmings. I had a braised shoulder of veal, amazingly tender, with some kind of incredibly intense reduction whose wonderful flavour I couldn&#8217;t identify, and parsnips, which I adore and which far too few restaurants cook.</p>
<p>These are not nouvelle portions, which is not a trivial issue given the richness of the food. We were all pretty much groaning by the end of it, and I was the only one who ventured into dessert, on the strict understanding that Jo ate half, when everyone else had tea and coffee.  Liquid-centred hot chocolate pudding, white chocolate crème brûlée, and a sort of intense berry sorbet thing which was absolutely essential in order to survive the chocolate, which was <em>savage</em>, again in a good way. I need to learn how to make this chocolate thing, it was delectable &#8211; rather like an inverted self-saucing pudding, but with very high quality dark chocolate and no restraint whatsoever.</p>
<p>The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, but by the time we left &#8211; for which read &#8220;rolled out the door, groaning&#8221; &#8211; it had filled up with a very lively, chatty, happy crowd. It&#8217;s quite noisy, but not intrusively so &#8211; the vibe is actually lovely. The service slows down a bit as the room fills up, understandably enough, but never to the point of being annoying, and the staff are smiley and pleasant. Also, parking is easy, lots around the corner with a car-guard. Which is fortunate, because we were too full to walk far.</p>
<p>It was a lovely evening, we like this place. On the Patent Jo Scale:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 9 / 10 (unexpectedly warm and cosy given the trendoid tendencies)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (Cheerful, attentive, unobtrusive.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (a bit variable, slowed down as the place filled up)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 9 / 10 (Yum.)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 9 / 10 (really very reasonable prices for such carefully-prepared, creative dishes)</p>

<p>Oh dear, it has been a while. So far back that I only have general impressions left and few specifics. I will do my best, anyway.</p>
<p>The general feeling was positive &#8211; good ambiance, good service, good food. However, it was priced like an Overture but really was more of an upmarket Italian/steak place and not quite as inventive as I expected. More detail:</p>
<p>Food: *faint memories*&#8230; there was meat, and there was things-with-sauce. The meat was not outstanding &#8211; it was good but not brilliant, and not good enough to be the &#8220;speciality of the house&#8221;. The things-with-sauce &#8211; Pork, I think, and was it springbok or osso buco? Or springbok osso buco. It was very very good, in a home-cooked goodness kind of way (large portions, rich sauces), which is slightly out of kilt with the ver&#8217; posh vibe, but that&#8217;s no reason for complaint. The carpaccios (which have their own section of the menu) were good, but not amazing, and the steak tartare, which I can&#8217;t resist, was not as good as I like it &#8211; the balance of condiments was not right.</p>
<p>Service: Excellent if occasionally slightly scarce. The bread basket at start was really interesting with all sorts of different home-baked things. Service highlight: Deliberating over desert, some of the party eventually ordered (yummy) things, and the waiter turned to me. &#8220;Nothing for me&#8221;, I said, until he turned away and was walking off. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; I called. &#8220;A SPOON.&#8221; He nearly keeled over giggling. I like cracking waiters up.</p>
<p>Ambiance: Lovely decor, very pleasant, light and modern. All works together.</p>
<p>Value for money: Slightly too pricey for its offering. Only one bottle of corkage allowed &#8211; but communicated nicely so we let it slip.</p>
<p>Altogether: It was nice, but won&#8217;t become a regular.</p>
<p>Food: 7</p>
<p>Ambiance: 8</p>
<p>Service: 8</p>
<p>Value for money: 6</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Let us say, just to start with, that there&#8217;s absolutely nothing wrong with a steakhouse. A steakhouse is a lovesome thing, God wot. This whole Salty Cracker lark started with a steakhouse, the Hussar, and it&#8217;s still a favourite haunt. A steakhouse is perfectly capable of offering a superlative experience of its kind, and should be measured not against fancy Frenchy food or nouveau whatsits, but against the Platonic steakhouse ideal, redolent of warmth, informality, substantial food, lack of pretension, a certain speedy facility in the service, and above all, superlative steak as a centrepiece, a kind of religious icon of carnivorous pleasure. Hussar does it in everything except the service. Nelson&#8217;s Eye sets new heights to the steak bar and vaults them with ease, rendering its lack of actual side-dish accomplishments moot. I personally eat steak about twice a year, but I thoroughly enjoy it &#8211; and the evil chippy trimmings &#8211; when I do. The Evil Landord defaults to the steak-ey with his choices, and it&#8217;s absolutely OK by me.</p>
<p>All that being said, it remains a tragic truth that the Famous Butcher&#8217;s Grill simply doesn&#8217;t deliver. It should have rung warning bells when the Evil Landlord had to undertake a mini epic quest just to track one down &#8211; the branches in the suburbs seem to have closed down in the last year or so, which does not auger a franchise in the bloom of meaty health. The remaining branch is in the Cape Town Lodge, a hotel in the CBD, and even on a Friday night with live music was not a seething locus of steak-guzzling activity.</p>
<p>The ambiance isn&#8217;t bad: it has a reasonable feeling of cosiness, and really quite pervable scrolly brocade designs in the wallpaper and tablecloths. I can&#8217;t think that the live music is a plus, though; it&#8217;s too small a venue for a guitar dude with the amp cranked up high, and it was frankly intrusive. (He didn&#8217;t have a bad voice and the music was recognisable 70s-90s guitar pop, but reinterpretations of Chris Rea do not aid my digestion.) It also helps to be given a small, complimentary bowl of perfectly adequate leek-and-potato soup as a welcome and a talisman against the cold of the evening, which has been a little sharp-tooth-bitey winter recently. The waiter was pleasant, attentive and willing to be amused by the usual Salty Cracker antics; the service is mostly good, and our starters arrived astonishingly quickly. The food, however: the food is &#8230; adequate. Okay, shading down into &#8220;not up to scratch&#8221; in some areas. Mostly as ordered, but in the &#8220;serviceable&#8221; category rather than even the &#8220;good&#8221;. Nothing inedible, but nothing really exciting.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t blown away by the starter offerings, but most of the usual suspects are there; deep-fried Camembert, calamari, the standard steakhouse fare. (I was deeply amused to see that they advertise a basket-of-blitong starter as &#8220;African Sushi&#8221;). Often this sort of basic starter off a small menu is done very well at a steakhouse, but my calamari had a rather dry, crumbly breading to it, and wasn&#8217;t exciting for flavour or texture. How difficult is it to spice up a breading? Honestly. Stv and the EL had the Camembert, fairly inevitably, which seemed to be OK &#8211; sufficiently gloopy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and Stv managed to polish off the whole thing, which is something of a testament given his tendency to shrivel up and die when overly cheesed. Jo&#8217;s Avocado Ritz was a bit odd &#8211; piles of lettuce and a seafood mayonnaise pile under which some lonely avocado bits presumably lurked. She&#8217;ll have to weigh in on how it actually tasted, but it looked like very 50s cuisine to me.</p>
<p>We all had steak &#8211; T-bone, rump, fillet medallions. My medallions were nicely tender, cooked in brandy with a peppercorn sauce which was rather good; the grade of meat itself was excellent, and the specified &#8220;rare&#8221; actually achieved, although to the bleu end of the spectrum rather than the medium. (And, no, this isn&#8217;t because of all the vampire tv lately: I&#8217;ve always liked my steak rare. I only have it every six months or so, but when I do I crave it bloody). The only problem was that they don&#8217;t actually sear the outside properly, which means it was a sort of grey rather than being grilled to brown; in fact, this seems to have been a feature of all the steaks for the evening, rather a travesty given the &#8220;grill&#8221; delineation. Also, I seem to have got lucky with the fillet: Jo said her rump was tough, the EL reported his &#8220;stringy around the edges&#8221;, and Stv&#8217;s T-bone wasn&#8217;t properly cooked next to the bone despite a request for &#8220;medium rare&#8221;. The side dishes were perfectly arb as well as perfectly carb &#8211; mounds of bland mashed potato, undistinguished chips, the usual butternut/creamed spinach duo in the name of vitamins. (And what&#8217;s with that? As the EL pointed out at the time, all steakhouses seem to default to those two vegetables, probably because they&#8217;re easy to produce as large vats of glop. Or because there are deep underlying signifiers which one of these fine days I shall deconstruct).</p>
<p>All this being the case, it&#8217;s extremely lucky the EL found four hitherto unsuspected remaining bottles of Diemersfontein Pinotage under his bed, and brought two of them along; we polished them off, and it made up for a lot. We ended up full, but curiously unsatisfied; we didn&#8217;t bother to stay for dessert.</p>
<p>I fear that, on the Patented SC Scale, the Famous Butcher&#8217;s Grill is not that famous. The Judge from Really Bloody Steak awards the following:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 6 / 10 (pleasant enough setting, points docked for inappropriate loud music)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (Cheerful, attentive, vanished a couple of times and had to be extracted with forceps by the desk person.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (quick to very quick, needed some prompting for water refills and wine-opening)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 6 / 10 (meh. Could have been worse.)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 6 / 10 (really would like to see more bang for my buck)</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Yet again, I find myself saying &#8220;<a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/07/02/fujiyama-review/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2009/07/02/fujiyama-review/', 'This is not a review of Kubo’s Little Japan on Riebeek St in town']);">This is not a review of Kubo’s Little Japan on Riebeek St in town</a>&#8220;.<br/>
It is however a review of the slightly oddly named Sushi Master on Riebeek St in town, which is what Kubo&#8217;s has become. A fine Korean gentleman by the name of Jung has taken over Kubo&#8217;s old spot, including (it seems) the menu. This is good since I was aiming for Japanese, not Korean, food.</p>
<p>[Pssst! Looking for the short version? It&#8217;s here: &#8220;cheap, good, Japanese food, despite the change of hands&#8221;]</p>
<h3>Boom, Shake, Shake, Shake The Room</h3>
<p>The evening did not get off to an auspicious start. The Boom Boom Shakalak bar above was quiet, but not quiet. It was fairly empty (quiet), but they seemed to be testing the maximum volume of their speakers (not quiet). Well, I whine, but it wasn&#8217;t exactly deafening. It did make for an interesting &#8220;mix&#8221; of their boomboom and Kubo / Sushi Master&#8217;s selection (of Richard Clayderman, The Magical Sound of the Pan Pipes, and assorted authentic eastern tunes). I felt The Fear that I&#8217;d picked a clanger for Cracker. Luckily this was not to be the case.</p>
<p>The decor was classic. Classic in the sense of horrible kitsch that sort of works, a la Minato&#8217;s.<br/>
We popped open one of our two bottles of vino (R15 corkage, btw. R15! Stick that in your pretentious pipe and smoke it, Aubergine! (Yes, still bitter about that.)) and perused the menu. Cheap! Interesting! Japanese!</p>
<h3>And So It Begins&#8230;</h3>
<p>We shared two plates of mixed tempura (prawns, calamari, veggies) for starters. Tasty! This was definitely Tempura Done Right and made me very happy. Bubbly, light, crispy batter, tasty sauce accompaniment. I could probably have handled another few pieces, but they weren&#8217;t stingy portions.</p>
<h3>The Mains Event</h3>
<p>For mains, we had a veritable 食べ放題 of goodies: beef tataki<sup>1</sup> with ponzu sauce; beef teppanyaki<sup>2</sup>; Chicken Kara-age<sup>3</sup>; chicken and veggies noodles fry-up; roast salmon belly; chawan mushi<sup>4</sup>. All the nosh was good, but stars for me were the beef tataki (pink!) and the salmon (pink!). Nom (pink!)!</p>
<h3>The Dessert Of The Real</h3>
<p>Then, unusually for Cracker, we had dessert. Bar one tempura and ice cream. So crazy it works.<br/>
Tasty tiny treat to round off the meal. Eck had his own, the J, J, S threesome shared two.</p>
<h3>Conclusions, Thoughts, Comments</h3>
<p>The total was R600, including a generous tip, which seems very reasonable given that we ate loads.<br/>
Certainly cheaper than lots of previous Crackers.</p>
<p>Alas, I fear that the Master of Sushi may not last. Part of it is that it&#8217;s cheap. And small. Both of these I see as plus points as a patron, but it must make it more difficult to make money. A more pertinent part is that we were the only people present. From 7 to 10pm. On a Saturday night. Oh, as they say, dear. I suspect that Kubo&#8217;s attracted a very local following that will desert the new look / theme / vibe / owner, given how fickle Cape Town eaters are.</p>
<h3>Patented Jo Scores on the Doors</h3>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 3 / 10 (kitschy decor works, but booming music is distracting. We enjoyed our meal despite it (had rather a jolly time, actually), but it would have much better without.)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 7 / 10 (Nice waitress lady, smiley sushi chef (even though we had none of his wares), very friendly and earnest owner (language barrier made interactions more entertaining / interesting))<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (Not particularly attentive, but easily signal-able given small space, and food came well-paced, as it was ready, piping hot (esp. important for tempura))<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 8 / 10 (Me liked. Interesting, new Japanese food. A bit different to other places which generally serve sushi as their Japanese stuff, or some kind of bastard-love-child-fusion thing which, while tasty, is not really Japanese Food.)<br/>
Value for money: 9 / 10 (Our final bill was low for Cracker, perhaps still a little high in general, but we had <em>lots</em> of nosh for our cash)</p>
<p>Fellow Crack-ees: what was the other category we wanted to add?</p>
<p>________________________________<br/>
1 &#8211; basically very rare, sliced beef. Watching this being cooked was awesome. Big chunk of meat, held in tongs, waved at flame of gas hob. Hypnotic.<br/>
2 &#8211; beef cube stir fry thingy<br/>
3 &#8211; Japanese style fried chicken<br/>
4 &#8211; steam egg custardy thing in a tiny bowl. Um&#8230; <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=chawanmushi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.za/search?q=chawanmushi', 'google it']);">google it</a>!<br/>
5 &#8211; there is no five, you may have noticed. Except that there is because this is it. This is a secret bit. You may have noticed that we had no sushi. A bit odd when going to a place called Sushi Master. Well, since it&#8217;s only really Jo and I who are the sushi monkeys, and that there was so much other interesting stuff to try, and that I&#8217;m on a quest for Japanese food that is not sushi, we decided to forgo said raw fish for that night. Jo and I will return by ourselves, or with other sushi monkeys, and try some then. The menu looked shortish, but with interesting animals. We&#8217;ll be back!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>For someone with an obsessive-compulsive blogging habit, I forget to blog my Salty Cracker choices way too often. Sigh. Sorry. Yindee&#8217;s was a while back now, end of March, which in fact meant the first of April owing to the mad socialising in the previous week. I chose Yindee&#8217;s slightly cautiously, because the First Rule of Salty Cracker Club is Good Food By Strict Rotation of Choice, but the Second Rule is Not Thai, because none of it is ever as good as Thai as cooked by Stv. (The Third Rule is They Must Allow Us To Bring Wine. The Fourth Rule is that Whoever Chooses Also Drives, with corollaries (a) my car is too small so sometimes I drive home for someone else, and (b) Jo Will Drink Lots And Hardly Ever Drive). However, I wrung the admission from my fellow members that (a) Yindee&#8217;s is fun, and (b) we could do Thai as long as it wasn&#8217;t any dish Stv usually cooks. Since this to me means all the crunchy deep-fried starter thingies, for which I cherish an illicit passion without any shame whatsoever, Yindee&#8217;s it was.</p>
<p>I also wanted something not too upmarket for this, because we did another Overture run the weekend before, and trying to be upmarket after Overture is always an anticlimax. One needs distance.  Yindee&#8217;s had exactly the right vibe &#8211; not too expensive, generally relaxed sort of feel, decent food, waiter with a big grin, lots of dark wood in the décor. It all adds up. The major mistake I made, though, was to agree to try out their low-table cushions-on-the-floor room when I booked. It sounded like a fun idea at the time, but I forgot about my knees. It was never quite comfortable, which I found distracted from the experience &#8211; I managed not to break any portion of myself, but there was considerable whale-like floundering in getting up and down. We have now Done This, and don&#8217;t need to repeat it. Chairs are my new religion.</p>
<p>They have a one-bottle-per-table corkage policy, causing the Evil Landlord to fulminate something &#8216;orrible, but in the event their wine list is quite extensive and there are sufficient inexpensive options not to be offensive. (Is it just me, or are CT restaurants limiting corkage bottles more and more often? I blame the recession). Also, jo&amp;stv brought a really good white, although I cannot for the life of me remember which. We did the standard oriental food thing, which was to order one dish each, bung them all in the middle of the table and share, culminating in arguments about who gets the last piece of duck. (Usually me).</p>
<p>Starters were good! fish cake thingies nicely flavourful, slightly standard beef satay and sweetcorn fritters, and <em>really</em> good potato strips in a sesame batter, my favourite from this course. Must try this at home. (I try the sweetcorn fritters at home, frequently, and have to say mine are better, mostly because I can&#8217;t restrain myself from Bunging Extra Stuff In, usually more chilli). We eschewed tempura on the grounds that it isn&#8217;t Thai, although I would have cheerfully suffered the inauthenticity. Deep fried things in batter make me strangely happy.</p>
<p>I chose, of course, duck for mains, crispy deboned duck with a rather delectable tamarind sauce &#8211; yum. The Evil Landlord had seared tuna, which was excellent, in a sort of herb crust. I think Jo had fish of some kind in a garlic and pepper stir fry, yes? also very good. I am totally, utterly and completely unable to remember what Stv ordered. It was also good. There were no actual bad choices here: the mains were better than the starters, I thought, with interesting flavours. The portions are reasonably substantial &#8211; I could have done with marginally more, and certainly more in the way of veggie components to the dishes, but we were all full enough not to want dessert.</p>
<p>This was a good experience, but not a brilliant one &#8211; solid food, nice vibe and setting without being particularly memorable, reasonable service but not outstanding. (Our waiter vanished completely when we wanted to pay him, and had to be summoned from the depths with strange rituals). Yindee&#8217;s bills itself as an &#8220;authentic&#8221; Thai experience, but I fear Stv&#8217;s cooking has spoiled us for that. It pretty much lives up to its cost bracket: I&#8217;d eat here again cheerfully and with enjoyment, but not to mark any special occasion. It certainly doesn&#8217;t trump our benchmark for Mid-Level Eastern Food, which is Jewel Tavern &#8211; flavour, quantity, vibe are all trailing behind the Tavern&#8217;s delirious high. Besides, a Lazy Susan on the table adds bonus style points which are difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>On the Patented Jo Table, the judge from Eastern Knee Troubles offers the following:</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8 / 10 (nice try on the low tables, good vibe)<br/>
<strong>Staff</strong>: 8 / 10 (pleasant, cheerful. Too often Cape Town waiters appear to be confirmed misanthropes.)<br/>
<strong>Service</strong>: 7 / 10 (occasionally absent/slow, but passed the Water Test with flying colours)<br/>
<strong>Food</strong>: 7 / 10 (good but not spectacular)<br/>
<strong>Value for money</strong>: 8 / 10 (priced unpretentiously and appropriately)</p>
