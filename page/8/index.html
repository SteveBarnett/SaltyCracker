<p>Okay, so it wasn&#8217;t shortly, and this isn&#8217;t really a review, but it needs to be said that Cargills (<a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-50.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_details-MemberID-50.html', 'at dining-out.co.za']);">at dining-out.co.za</a>, <a href="http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&#038;RestaurantID=2966" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&amp;RestaurantID=2966', 'at eatout.co.za']);">at eatout.co.za</a>) was fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the distant past now, so I unfortunately can&#8217;t remember much detail (that&#8217;s my advanced age for you), but the general standard of food was excellent. The waiter was attentive and friendly without being clingy (important in such a small venue) and the chef was pleasingly cheery when he came out to see how the food was going down. Slightly short, slightly round, very smiley. :)</p>
<p>I think there were mussels, Camembert, and mushrooms for starters &#8211; nummy!<br/>
Main courses were Sole with parsley lemon butter (gentle and subtle and cooked to perfection), Springbok with mixed berry jus (great red flavours to match the red meat), Confit of Duck (Jess, comments, as our resident duckspert?) Beef Fillet Bordelaise (good cow!).</p>
<p>There were five of us, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some things.<br/>
Like the stir fried veggies that are served as sides instead of the standard meh creamed spinach and fries. Very tasty.</p>
<p>Om nom nom!</p>

<p>Or,</p>
<h3>A Tale Of Two Restaurants</h3>
<p>It was the best of Crack, it was the worst of Crack.<br/>
No, wait.<br/>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a Salty Cracker.<br/>
Uh&#8230; no.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a review of <a href="http://eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&#038;RestaurantID=5599" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article-int', 'http://eatout.co.za/restaurants/restaurant_overview.asp?iSearch=1&amp;RestaurantID=5599', 'Kubo&#8217;s Little Japan']);">Kubo&#8217;s Little Japan</a> on Riebeek St in town, even though that was my choice for June Crackage.<br/>
Jo&#8217;s eagle eyes spotted it tucked away near the corner of Buitengracht and Riebeek street, and we hung a U-turn to park smartly right by the front door. It looked kind of quiet (and dark), but we ventured in anyways. Turns out Kubo&#8217;s is shut for the next few months, as the kind gentleman in the Boom Boom Shakalak bar on the floor above informed us.</p>
<p>Walking briskly back to the car, we shot off for my back up plan: <a href="http://home.intekom.com/fujiyama/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://home.intekom.com/fujiyama/', 'Fujiyama']);">Fujiyama</a> (conveniently located under <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/03/28/cedar-cafe/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://174.120.62.98/~naga/saltycracker.co.za/2008/03/28/cedar-cafe/', 'Cedar Cafe']);">Cedar Cafe</a>). Also looked kind of quiet (and dark), and had a &#8220;To Let&#8221; sign in the window. Twas not boding well.<br/>
However, they were open &#8211; huzzah! And tasty &#8211; hazzuh!<br/>
We were the only people in the front room all night, which was kind of strange, but kind of entertaining too. Noticed right at the end of the night that there were three other rooms there, including a traditional shoes-off, low-down-table one. Squee!</p>
<p>We got a little bowl of some marinated nummy, soy saucey, slighty sweety tuna for an appetiser, then dove into a table-shared two big plates of veggie and fishy tempura and a plate of chicken katsu. Nom!<br/>
The chicken was good, but the tempura was ace. Very light and crispy.</p>
<p>Main course action was: beef soba (soup w/ thin noodles) for Jo; beef udon (soup w/ fat noodles) for me; chicken nabe (brothy soup w/ noodles) for Jess; fillet teppanyaki for Eckhard.<br/>
My soup was very, very, tasty and had a nice, thinly sliced, chunk of meat and a few crunchy veggies in.<br/>
Eck&#8217;s fillet cubes were medium-rared to perfection.</p>
<p>The wine list was also reasonably priced. It is, of course, marked up from farm price, but not by a nosebleed-inducing amount (unlike someplaces *cough* myoga *cough*. Well, to be fair, <em>most</em> restaurants.).</p>
<p>The bad news is they&#8217;re closing, sort of, in the next few days. Actually, they&#8217;re moving to two spots on Long Street. One on Long, opposite the Purple Turtle, for take-aways, and one around the corner for sit-downs (the head waiter gentlemen kindly informed us on our way out).</p>
<p>All in all, a successful Crackage, despite the initial impending doom feeling when 1st choice was closed.<br/>
I look forward to trying their new place. Japanese food FTW!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Our enthusiastic applause for the Ginga experience prompted my choice of <a href="http://www.myoga.co.za/web/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myoga.co.za/web/', 'Myoga']);">Myoga</a>, the larney restaurant at the Vineyard hotel in Claremont. I&#8217;d originally wanted to try La Colombe, which was booked solid (apparently two weeks&#8217; lead-in time for a weekend booking is required, ooh la la), so the general plan was up-market. Up-market is certainly what we got.</p>
<p>Myoga has a lovely feel &#8211; luxurious, carpeted, highly-designed, all warm and orange and plush &#8211; it&#8217;s something of an antithesis to Ginja&#8217;s we-slapped-the-red-paint-on-the-wall-ourselves aesthetic, but retains at least partly its comfortable feel. The kitchen sits in the middle of the restaurant, so one can watch the controlled chaos of the chefs and catch them rather endearingly sticking sauce spoons into their mouths and then back into the pot. (I always do this, and have hitherto always felt madly guilty about it). The restaurant&#8217;s bathrooms rate a special mention for the décor dubbed &#8220;futurist nightclub&#8221; by Jo &#8211; if the joint was ever raided, heaven forfend, by the timecops, the loos could simply fire up their blue lights, rotate a few chrome fittings and glide quietly back to the mother ship. Also, there are screens on the back of the toilet doors which show a live feed to the kitchens, which is curiously disconcerting while communing with one&#8217;s bodily functions.</p>
<p>The menu is very similar to Ginja, featuring the same wonderful flavour combinations in a sort of modernist flow-of-consciousness description, and beautifully-sculped piles of strange shapes and colours presented with a flourish in a lonely island in the middle of a giant plate. My smoked duck-breast starter (the quest for Cape Town&#8217;s Best Duck continues) featured piquant, vinegary flavours in addition to wanton touches of toasted peanut, pomegranate seed and turkish delight, with foie gras crouton-thingies on the side. It was delectable &#8211; complex, playful, unexpected. The dessert chocolate plate was also quite possibly better than sex, with coffee ice-cream, variegated mousses, dense chocolate tart and a molten chocolate death pudding productive of helpless orgasmic noises and a liberal coating of chocolate all over my hands and face. (The second visit to the Ablutions of the Future was necessitated at about this point). Jo&#8217;s assiette of desserts included a sort of frozen berry explosion thing that cut the chocolate death very nicely, and a not entirely successful pound cake effort &#8211; stodgy, confusing. I was wrapped up enough in my duck that I didn&#8217;t really taste anyone else&#8217;s starter, but the Evil Landlord seemed to enjoy his scallops, and stv his tuna &#8211; I am entirely unable to remember what sort of flavours they came with.</p>
<p>I have somewhat deliberately skipped from starter to dessert because the main course, frankly, disappointed me. The trio of veal is apparently something of a Myoga signature dish, and the flavours were lovely &#8211; three medallions each with a separate saucing, including an intense mushroom/truffle thing, lemon and anchovy with aubergine, and a green pepper sauce. The potato croquettes, mashed potato with subtle herbs in a fried crumb crust, were incredible. But the meat was arb, a sort of vague, tasteless carrier for the admittedly vivid and interesting sauces. I&#8217;m rather wishing I&#8217;d gone with the Evil Landlord&#8217;s venison in chocolate sauce with plums, or stv&#8217;s incredible beef fillet with duck liver pâté.</p>
<p>That wouldn&#8217;t have been too much of a problem, though &#8211; the sauces were definitely worth it, and the whole meal thing, at just over R200 for three courses, was not badly priced for the larney experience it is. The problem, and the reason why Myoga isn&#8217;t up there with Ginja in my estimation, was the wine. Myoga has a sommelier, which is always a bit touch-and-go with me because it&#8217;s not really possible to talk about wine without pretentious language. Jo&#8217;s Aubergine rant about little fishes going sploosh and the rrrah! of earthy polar bears is always floating vaguely about my head, and I have to be careful not to catch her eye otherwise unseemly giggling will result. Also, fundamentally, while the idea of an experienced wine-fundi pairing the right wine with your meal is all fine and well, in fact it&#8217;s a rotten swizz on many levels &#8211; you are gently guided into ordering on recommendation, without recourse to the wine list, and thus disempowered on one quite important level of choice, namely price. The wine cost more than the meal did. The sommelier swore he was guiding us to the cheaper choices, but I don&#8217;t personally feel that R300 for a bottle of wine is actually cheap. This was the most expensive Salty Cracker we&#8217;ve ever had, and the wine was frankly way overpriced. The recommendations were good and interesting (well, I wasn&#8217;t a fan of the pinot noir, found it thin and flat), but they weren&#8217;t worth that money. It was a huge pity, because you end up feeling that the meal experience has been devalued, and the devaluation had really nothing to do with the actual food.</p>
<p>So, on Jo&#8217;s four-point scale I&#8217;d score it thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: 8</li>
<li><strong>Staff</strong>: 7</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: 8</li>
<li><strong>Value for money</strong>: 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus points for the lovely garden and the warning signs about the feral tortoise.</p>

<p>By common, unchecked consensus, this may be my first choice since the unmentionable purple vegetable related restaurant. Of which we shall not speak. And if it is such, I forgive myself all my brinjally sins! Overture is Redemption!</p>
<p>Overture was on Eat-out&#8217;s list of top-10 restuarants of the year, which can or cannot be a good thing. More that that, every single of the 17 people who made comments on eat-out website said things like:</p>
<p>&#8211; best restaurant experience ever!</p>
<p>&#8211; most wonderful service ever!</p>
<p>&#8211; amazingest food ever!</p>
<p>And it was all true.</p>
<p>Overture is at Hidden Valley wine estate, so named because you will u-turn at least once on the way there and there are windy, dark country roads which seem entirely too long to fit into the space on the map where the farm should be. Overture itself is a summery lunch place, which is why we obviously needed to have dinner there in winter*. We got there on time (40 min from cape town) and it was dark, and cold, and unobvious where to go, and did I mention the cold?</p>
<p>This concludes any negatives I may have had, and at this point we get to the restaurant.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need to go for a summer lunch. It would have the most amazing views &#8211; wraparound balcony high up, with vineyards as far as the eye would be able to see, were there light. In winter, the inside is a modern, wood-and-stone-and-metal type building, with warm light and high ceilings and one of those completely open kitchens for additional entertainment.</p>
<p>The staff were lovely. We had 3 people looking after us, which normally is a bad sign (purple! vegetable! alert!) but wasn&#8217;t here. I remember most of their names, which is a good sign (thank you Vision and Brenda!), and they were omni-present, very helpful, knowledgeable and had a sense of humour.</p>
<p>Tap-water test: Passed with flying colours. &#8220;Would you like some still or sparkling water?&#8221; &#8220;A big jug of tap water would be nice?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; With a smile. And that was it. And the very lovely Brenda ensured water glasses were never empty. Yay!</p>
<p>Bits and pieces: Lovely, warm bread served straight away with olive oil, and every time we were finishing a plate of food, mop up sauce with!. Also, baby marrow mousse/soup taster thingy served straight after ordering to make sure we were never empty-handed. And delicious things they were!</p>
<p>Wine: This is a no-bring-your-own-place (we checked in advance), but they have, beside wine list, a very recomendable food-and-wine pairing thing. Which I recommend. The deal is, their 3, 4 or 5 course menu can be served with matched wine or not. It is unusually reasonable to do the matching thing, and well worth it. It is so reasonable, in fact, that I was expecting the wine portions to be measly, I mean, elegantly restrained. Instead, they were enormously bountiful and very tasty to boot. The idea, I gathered, was to make sure that we always had something to drink. For example, the Chicken Liver Pate and Snails starter dish came with a glass of noble late harvest on the menu, which was delivered ahead of the food, along with an unexpected and unmentioned glass of delicious chardonnay, to &#8220;have something to sip on while you wait for the food&#8221;. Bliss! And danger to designated drivers, a position from which I was allowed to abdicate half way through the evening with some relief (thank you, Jess!!!).</p>
<p>Now for food: 3, 4 or 5 courses, as said, where all items from the menu are eligible for the deal. So 2 mains followed by 2 deserts and a starter is fine, IF you are insanely hungry and have a couple of spare stomachs to stuff five courses into. Or your name is Landlord, Evil Landlord. (Though he at least had his starter-starter-main-main-desert in the right order.)</p>
<p>The prices are actually very reasonable, ranging from R195 for 3 courses, no wine, to R350 for 5 courses, with ample rivers of wine. We ended up having around 4 courses each, according to a rather complicated matrix<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course 1</strong>:</p>
<p><em>(All)</em>: The kingklip, smoked, with poached egg and a hollandaisy but not really creamy whitey sauce. Paired with Hidden Valley Rose, which is suprising un-rose like (tastes more like a white, which is how I like my Roses). Lovely. Rich. Mope-plate-with-bread-to-hoover-up-the-sauce-y.</p>
<p>Accidental (involuntary muscle twitches!) stealing of last bit of kingklip from Stv’s plate done by me. I am sorry! There is no excuse!!!</p>
<p><strong>Course 2</strong>:</p>
<p><em>(Jo and EL)</em>: Snails cooked in red wine with Chicken Liver Pate. Served with a creamy green (why green? I don’t know!) sauce. Paired with aforementioned Late Harvest/Chardonnay duo. Very very rich, but lovely flavours. Snails not tasting snail like, pate very fluffy and light but rich at the same time. This was kind of the theme for the day. More bread. Mop, Mop.</p>
<p><em>(Jess)</em>: Spinach Soup with bread dumplings with cheese inside. Rich and wonderful. With one of the 2 Sauvingnons.</p>
<p><em>(Stv)</em>: Malawian-heritaged fish from Bredarsdorp (local ingredients thing) something like talepi? tamale? Thumbelini? Something of the sort. With risotto bianco and tomato risotto. Surprisingly, my favourite flavour combination for the evening (cue coveting Stv&#8217;s dish. Tuck fingers under seat for dining safety). Yum and light and fluffy and all those things. With another Sauvignon, judged even nicer than the Spinach Soupy one.</p>
<p>Some under-the-tablecloth bread trade observed between the Fish and the Spinach Soup. Just saying.</p>
<p><strong>Course 3</strong>: (Wondering if we can actually have any more than this, despite firm 4 course plans)</p>
<p><em>(Jess)</em>: Duck. I cannot remember how it was done or what it came with, only the extreme juicy deliciousness of it. Mmmmhmmm… duck…. And it came with the Hidden Valley Merlot, which was dark and berry-y and the wine winner for the evening by universal, glass-sharing concensus.</p>
<p><em>(All others)</em>: Pork Belly. Rolled into a little rolly thing. With root veg. And other things. Emergency systems kicking in, memory closing down to make room for expanded stomach. It was awesome. With HV Pinotage, which was classic and fitting and unfairly pitted against the Merlot. Poor Pinotage.</p>
<p><strong>Course 4:</strong> (Tam-da-Dam!)</p>
<p><em>(EL)</em>: Duck, and Merlot, and going (reasonably) strong.</p>
<p><em>(Jess):</em> Malva pudding with cinnamon ice cream, under protest, shared with Stv in order to ensure survival.</p>
<p><em>(Jo)</em>: Sits this one out. Moans. Holds extremities. Gets teased by waiters about early defeat. Digests furiously..</p>
<p><strong>Course 5: </strong>(To the Escape Pods!)</p>
<p><em>(EL):</em> Slightly pale. Braves Malva Pudding. Shows no appreciation for cinnamon ice cream.</p>
<p><em>(Stv, Jess): </em>Sensibly avoid any more food. Not even my most excellent desert.</p>
<p><em>(Jo):</em> I’m having rib-eye steak for desert! My life is complete! The waiters are impressed! (Or horrified. Don’t care.) I may explode, but: Rib eye steak, medium rare, with a thin sliver of rare liver (!) (It works, but not as course 4. Liver spurned for purposes of retaining a little bit of digestive tract.) With lots of tiny mushrooms and <em>deep-fried gnocci</em> (works!). And Shiraz.</p>
<p>*Falls under table*</p>
<p>This, Ladies and Gentlemen, was a Fine<span> </span>Meal.</p>
<p>*Note for winter: it is small inside, and the outside tables are out of the question. So book early. By all accounts, book early in summer too. They are popular. We booked aweek in advance and got lucky, there was a cancellation! (It&#8217;s good good good so do it anyway!)</p>

<p><strong>Review in brief:</strong><br/>
food generally good, generous portions, reasonable prices, service a bit lacking.</p>
<p>So, after dipping out off a wine farm lunch on Friday due to time and heat constraints, we decided to Crack our Salty selves on Saturday instead.</p>
<p>I was in the mood for some Japanese food, but specifically not sushi. So, after hitting the <a href="http://eatout.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article-int', 'http://eatout.co.za/', 'Eat Out']);">Eat Out</a> and <a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/', 'Dining Out']);">Dining Out</a> sites and the EO book, I chose Benkei (<a href="http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_menu.asp?MemberID=2834" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dining-out.co.za/member_menu.asp?MemberID=2834', 'menu at DO']);">menu at DO</a>).</p>
<p>We did our usual frisky food swapping.<br/>
Our starters were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuna, Ginger and Wasabi Spring rolls with Sweet Chilli sauce,</li>
<li>Chicken Yakitori, kebab-style</li>
<li>Seafood Yakitori,</li>
<li>Tempura prawns, fish, calamari and veggies</li>
<li>Sashimi salad.</li>
</ul>
<p>All were pretty nummy, but special mention goes to the Spring Rolls (crunchy and good tuna) and the tempura (nice and crispy, good side sauce).<br/>
You may notice that there were five starters for four people.<br/>
We were hungry :).</p>
<p>Our mains were Teppanyaki stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beef Fillet</li>
<li>Seared Tuna Steak x 2</li>
<li>Seafood Platter (fish, prawns, calamari steak)</li>
</ul>
<p>They took quite a while bringing out the starters, and the mains arrived almost the instant they took the starters away, which was not great.<br/>
The tunii arrived seared to perfection, but unfortunately a bit cold. So, we sent them both back to be warmed up and they returned pretty much cooked. I was a bit miffed, but the fishies were still very tasty.<br/>
The Beefy was done just right (nice and pink and soft and good), and Eck&#8217;s seafood-for-two was a decent mix of denizens of the deep. I admit to being surprised that he managed to get the whole lot down &#8211; it was a whole lotta fish!</p>
<p>Overall quality of the service could be improved.<br/>
The waiters were friendly, but not quite attentive enough &#8211; we had to call our guy back to open our first bottle of wine for us (and I get <em>very</em> tetchy when I don&#8217;t have a drink in my hand soon after sitting down ;-] ).<br/>
And I was a bit annoyed by the fact that they started closing up the place while were still sitting there eating. This was before 10pm on a Saturday evening. Admittedly, we were the last ones there, but still.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m glad that I chose there, and I had a pleasant evening, but I won&#8217;t hurrying back there.<br/>
Plenty more Japanese joints to try!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>The club&#8217;s over-larnification at Aubergine has led to a snail-like drawing in of horns, and we&#8217;re all about the relaxed, mid-range experience at the moment. Wild Fig was perfect for this. For a start, it&#8217;s beautiful: quite apart from the piquant detail of being next door to the mental hospital, it has the stunning giant wild fig tree outside, and the restaurant itself is a white-painted house on multiple levels, curled around three sides of a courtyard full of trees. The interior is dark-painted, cosy and eclectic, and very slightly shabby in a way that&#8217;s intimate and comforting.</p>
<p>The food is rather a fun combination of nouvelle and pub: intense sauces, interesting flavour combinations, but with the portions approximately twice the size of somewhere like Aubergine, and the main course comes standard with roast potatoes and vegetables. We all overate horribly. Starters were substantial in themselves; I had spring rolls, slightly fatty but tasty, and the EL&#8217;s deep-fried camembert was perfectly done, a great improvement on the slightly stringy one we had at the Hussar. (Owing to my somewhat dilatory approach to this reviewing thing I can&#8217;t remember what anyone else had, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll chip in in the comments).</p>
<p>Main course enabled me to pursue my current goal of trying all the possible versions of duck in Cape Town in search of the perfect one: this was crispy duck in an orange sauce, very flavourful, with the kind of crispy skin that really requires one goes at the bones in one&#8217;s fingers. Other main courses at the table included, if I remember correctly, some sort of game in a chilli chocolate sauce, and a giant chunk of lamb shank &#8211; the usual ritual of fork-swopping was observed, and it was all very good.</p>
<p>We had to try dessert, despite being full, because the ice-cream offerings were so unusual. I had a brandysnap basket arrangement with berry ice-cream, somewhat delectable, but I think the chilli and honey nut ice-cream sandwich was even better, with wonderful flavour contrasts and a subtle bite.</p>
<p>If I have anything to carp about it was possibly the service, which was pleasant but slightly slow. This didn&#8217;t really matter, as it suited our relaxed mood perfectly.</p>
